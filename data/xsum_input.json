The stock has now declined more than 10% this year.\nTesco chief executive Dave Lewis said the results showed \"another solid year of progress\" at the supermarket giant.\n\"The very pleasing thing is that on every dimension of customer service we've had positive feedback from customers of the service that we're giving, and that's allowed us to drive an improvement in both sales and indeed profitability,\" he told the BBC's Emma Simpson.\nFull year pre-tax profit, which includes one-off charges such as legal costs, fell from £202m to £145m.\nBut Tesco's operating profit figure, which strips out exceptional items and reflects the performance of the business, was £1.28bn, exceeding Tesco's £1.2bn target.\nBy 2020, Mr Lewis wants Tesco to make between 3.5p and 4p of operating profit for every £1 spent by shoppers, up from 2.3p in 2016-17. The company is banking on rising sales, allowing it to cut £1.5bn of costs.\nThe supermarket also needs strong results to help it persuade shareholders to back its attempt to buy wholesaler Booker.\nLast month, one of its biggest shareholders said it had \"major concerns\" about the £3.7bn bid, saying it was overpaying.\nTesco said the deal would improve its recovery plans.\nThe supermarket giant's pension deficit more than doubled from £2.6bn to £5.5bn after higher inflation, said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Laith Kalaf.\n\"The supermarket is facing the prospect of a rise in pension contributions because its scheme valuation is rather inconveniently taking place now, when interest rates are low and inflation is rising, both of which will serve to magnify the deficit,\" he said.\nKantar Retail analyst Ray Gaul said Tesco can \"successfully put the accounting scandals of the past behind them having settled legal affairs\".\n\"Now, Tesco will begin to fight all of its battles on the front foot,\" he said.\nUpcoming \"battles\" include regulatory battles over the proposed Booker deal.\nSuppliers raising prices to cope with increased costs will be another test, Mr Gaul said. The pound has substantially weakened since the UK's vote to leave the European Union in June, pushing up the cost of imports.\nThe rate of grocery price inflation is expected to rise to 2.3%, with higher rises on the horizon, he added.\nDave Lewis told the BBC that Tesco \"want to do everything we can to stop prices rising ... but the fact is, they are, and there is some pressure in terms of pricing\".\nHe said customers were starting to shift spending to \"fresh food\" and \"everyday essentials\" rather than \"luxuries\".\nSupermarkets have been contending with factors including rising costs, the devaluation of the pound and structural shifts in the industry.\nMr Lewis said: \"It's no surprise that the industry has been under pressure, but it has been under pressure for the last three or four years as well. Actually I think that where we sit as Tesco now is stronger than we've been for quite some time.\"",

That is slowly beginning to have an effect.\nBut never has there been a suggestion that the US would renege on its responsibilities.\nHis comments on Turkey suggest that the Republican contender also seems reluctant to insist upon Nato members maintaining strong democratic principles.\nMr Trump's positions will be seen by Washington's Nato partners as at best eccentric and at worst alarming.\nAt a time of growing tensions with Moscow, the idea that the US might become an unreliable ally is a nightmare for Nato's European members.\nAsked about Russian aggression towards Nato countries in the Baltic region, Mr Trump suggested the US might abandon the longstanding protections offered by the US to such nations.\nThe divisive Republican candidate also said that, if elected, he would not pressure US allies over crackdowns on political opposition and civil liberties, arguing that the US had to \"fix our own mess\" before \"lecturing\" other nations.\nHe said: \"Look at what is happening in our country. How are we going to lecture when people are shooting policemen in cold blood?\"\nAsked about the failed coup in Turkey on Friday, the Republican candidate praised Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has been criticised by some Western leaders over his increasingly authoritarian rule.\n\"I give great credit to him for being able to turn that around,\" Mr Trump said of the failed coup. \"Some people say that it was staged, you know that,\" he said. \"I don't think so.\"\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry has urged Mr Erdogan to follow the rule of law, amid a crackdown on opposition figures by the Turkish leader in the wake of the coup attempt. But Mr Trump chose not to make a similar statement.\n\"When the world sees how bad the United States is and we start talking about civil liberties, I don't think we are a very good messenger,\" he said.\nThe Republican candidate also said that he would reassess the costs to the US of longstanding defence treaties, potentially forcing allies to take on those costs.\nHe said he would \"prefer to be able to continue\" existing agreements - but not if he felt allies were taking advantage of the US.\nReferring to what he said were US trade losses, Mr Trump said: \"We are spending a fortune on military in order to lose $800bn. That doesn't sound very smart to me.\"\nHe also suggested he would close US bases abroad. \"If we decide we have to defend the United States, we can always deploy\" from American soil, he said \"and it will be a lot less expensive\".\nMr Trump will address the convention on Thursday following speeches from his running mate, Governor Mike Pence and his wife Melania Trump.\nMrs Trump's speech caused embarrassment when journalists noticed that sections of the text appeared to have been copied directly from a speech given by Michelle Obama at the 2008 Democratic Convention.\nSenator Ted Cruz, who came second in the Republican primaries, was booed by convention-goers on Thursday after opting not to endorse Mr Trump in his speech.",

    "article": "\"[President Barack] Obama must now start focusing on OUR COUNTRY, jobs, healthcare and all of our many problems,\" he tweeted. \"Forget Syria and make America great again!\"\nTwo years ago Mr Trump built a winning presidential campaign around this very theme, sharply criticising Democrats and some fellow Republicans for what he viewed as their overly interventionist foreign policies.\nJust a week ago Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appeared to be following this new script when he downplayed calls for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's removal, saying his status \"will be decided by the Syrian people\".\nThen on Thursday night, two days after another chemical weapons attack, President Donald Trump ordered a guided missile strike on a Syrian government airfield.\nThe move marks a dramatic turnaround from Mr Trump's prior rhetoric and the expectations of how he would conduct his foreign policy.\nIn his remarks following the missile strike, the president explained that it was in the \"vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons\".\nHe even called on \"civilised nations\" to end the \"bloodshed and slaughter\" of the Syrian civil war and insisted that \"peace and harmony\" will prevail.\nThe man who was thought to be a neo-isolationist now, just months into his presidency, is projecting US military force abroad to enforce international norms and punish human rights abuses.\nWhat changed? It seems clear that the graphic images of dead and dying Syrian civilians - including \"beautiful babies\", in Mr Trump's words - had a dramatic effect on the president's disposition.\nWith a few notable exceptions, the strike is being praised by Washington politicians on the left and on the right. In the coming days, however, some serious questions will be posed.\nIf the president's foreign policy outlook can shift so dramatically in just a few days, if not hours, will allies and adversaries interpret this as a sign of flexibility or incoherence?\nA cruise missile strike is a low-risk form of military action, but it also is of limited effectiveness.\nA White House official described this as a warning shot across Mr Assad's bow.\nIf the Syrian president continues to use chemical weapons or conduct conventional attacks that result in significant civilian casualties, will the US escalate its military intervention or back down and risk appearing weak?\nWhen Mr Obama contemplated using force against the Syrian government, he decided that he would need congressional authorisation to do so. Will Mr Trump now seek approval from the lawmakers, on both sides of the aisle, who were reluctant to give the Democratic president such approval?\nThursday night was Mr Trump's first significant foreign policy challenge, and it appears to have dramatically changed his outlook, his rhetoric and his resulting actions. The candidate who constantly spoke of putting America first ended his brief remarks on Thursday night by calling for God's blessings not just for his nation but for the \"entire world\".\nThis strike - and this change of attitude - may simply be a one-off event. Or, perhaps, an unlikely globalist has been born.",

Listening to the things we're going to do to change that, if people come down from now they will find a very different experience.\n\"The infrastructure is still well away from where it needs to be but there are plans to develop that.\"\nCotton, 69, a former England and British and Irish Lions prop returned to Sale - a club he served as both a player and director - after Simon Orange's takeover of the Premiership side in June.\nHe has promised to be active in his role, despite his commitments with his clothing business.\n\"What I really want to see is a very strong north of England club that can compete at the highest level,\" he added.\n\"That is my motivation for giving up the precious thing that I have got, and that is my time.\n\"I think what was lacking before was that the board weren't very often represented at games home and away, and I think that is very wrong - board members will travel to away games and home games.\"\nOne of the standout announcements from Sale's new 10-man board was that director of rugby Steve Diamond will have a seat on it.\nHowever, Cotton insists there will be no conflict of interest with a member of the coaching staff also working as a director.\n\"It will put no strain whatsoever on the relationship, we're here to support him,\" Cotton continued.\n\"We'll be working very closely with Diamond to make sure we can achieve the ambition which we all hold - if we went down we'd still be with them.\"\nDiamond also confirmed they are close to signing a new full-back and are still looking for another player to add to their backline, with former Bath and London Welsh winger Nick Scott on trial with the club.",

    "article": "The Labour leader has also said he is \"very angry\" that so many lives were lost in a deadly tower block fire.\nPM Theresa May said the residents were \"in our thoughts and prayers\" and has ordered a public inquiry into the fire.\nBut she was criticised by a senior Labour MP for failing to meet residents when she visited the scene on Thursday.\nAt least 17 people died in the disaster at Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, west London in the early hours of Wednesday.\nMr Corbyn, who earlier released a statement saying he was \"very angry that it was possible for the fire to spread in the way it did,\" said people living in high-rise flats would be frightened following the Grenfell Tower disaster and needed answers to give them \"peace of mind\".\nAnd he told MPs on Thursday: \"The south part of Kensington is incredibly wealthy, it's the wealthiest part of the country.\n\"The ward where this fire took place is, I think the poorest ward in the whole country.\n\"And properties must be found, requisitioned if necessary, in order to make sure those residents do get re-housed locally.\n\"It cannot be acceptable that in London you have luxury buildings and luxury flats kept as land banking for the future while the homeless and the poor look for somewhere to live.\"\nMrs May met police and firefighters at a private visit to the site but was not seen speaking to residents who survived the attack. Mr Corbyn was pictured speaking to local people.\nLabour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan was heckled by some angry residents at the scene when he visited.\nMr Khan praised the local community spirit but added: \"People are angry and I share that anger.\"\nDowning Street said that Mrs May's visit was made to get a briefing from the emergency services to ensure that they had the resources they needed.\nBut Labour's former deputy leader Harriet Harman wrote on Twitter: \"Theresa May should have met Grenfell fire residents. She should have been prepared to listen to them Not OK to speak at them via TV.\"\nThe prime minister has praised the way the local community had supported the residents and praised the \"professionalism and bravery\" of the emergency services.\nShe pledged that the government \"stands ready to provide every assistance\" to the council and emergency services.\n\"I want to reassure the residents of Grenfell Tower - all of whom are in our thoughts and prayers - that the government will make every effort to make sure that they are re-housed in London and as close as possible to home.\"\nShe has ordered a judge-led public inquiry into the disaster. Ministers have also made emergency funding available to local authorities to support people affected.\nBut MPs demanded answers in a specially-arranged session in Westminster Hall on Thursday, while Parliament is still suspended.\nAt the start of the special meeting in Westminster's Grand Committee Room, Fire Minister Nick Hurd said: \"What we are dealing with here is a national tragedy.\"\nHe said the \"exceptionally complex\" investigation would take several months, and there would be no room for \"plodding bureaucracy\" in the official response.\n\"It is the intention of the government to leave absolutely no stone unturned,\" he said.\nAnswers were needed about fire walls, sprinkler systems, the alarm system and how the fire spread, he said.\n\"Every single person living in a high-rise building today will be frightened, will be traumatised and will be very, very worried.\"\nShadow housing minister John Healey urged ministers to begin installing sprinkler systems immediately and not to wait for the result of the public inquiry.\nThe new housing minister, Alok Sharma, said he too had heard accounts of residents who said they had warned about fire safety.\nThe government was talking to councils and housing associations about getting checks on other buildings done quickly, he said.\nAt the end of the meeting, he promised \"every single family\" would be re-housed in the local area.\nEarlier Theresa May ordered a full public inquiry, \"to ensure that this terrible tragedy is properly investigated\".\nLabour is calling for measures recommended after another fatal fire in 2009 to be implemented immediately.\nRecommendations made after a fire in a tower block in Lakanal House in Camberwell in which six people died included installing sprinkler systems in high-risk buildings and reviewing building regulations.\nIn October the former Housing Minister, Gavin Barwell, said the government had \"publicly committed\" to reviewing building regulations in relation to fire safety after the Lakanal House fire.\nMr Healey said this review had \"not been started\".\n\"The residents and others have some really serious questions to put to ministers and the people who run the building,\" he said.\nResponding to reports, the Department for Communities and Local Government said it was \"simply not true\" that a report about building regulations had been \"sat on\".\nThe BBC understands the Lord Chief Justice will make a recommendation to the prime minister of a judge to chair the inquiry.\nHe or she will be independent from the government and able to call who they want as a witness.\nThe Liberal Democrats have called for an urgent review into fire safety and building regulations.",

    "article": "Amina Al-Jeffery, 21, who was born and brought up in Swansea, was taken to Jeddah in 2012 by her father, Mohammed, who said he did it to \"save her life\".\nMr Al-Jeffery has denied the allegations at the High Court.\nBut Mr Justice Holman said she had been \"deprived of her liberty\" and her father must facilitate her return.\nMs Al-Jeffery, who has dual nationality, says her father took the action against her will after she \"kissed a guy\".\nDelivering the court order, Mr Justice Holman said Mr Al-Jeffery \"must permit and facilitate the return of Amina if she so wishes to Wales or England and pay the airfare\" by 11 September.\nHowever, he accepted there was \"little or nothing this court could do\" to enforce the order if Mr Al-Jeffery \"was determined not to comply with it\".\nBut he said Mr Al-Jeffery might face contempt of court proceedings if he returned to Britain without having complied.\nMr Justice Holman added: \"There are no conventions between Britain and Saudi Arabia. The courts in Saudi Arabia would not even recognise the basis of the claim, because it does not recognise dual nationality.\"\nHer lawyer, Anne-Marie Hutchinson QC, said she has been unable to take instruction from Ms Al-Jeffery, who sent her emails in December 2015.\nShe said she had been \"physically abused\" and there were times when she had not been allowed to leave her room, meaning she had to use it as a toilet.\nShe described having her head smacked against the wall.\nMs Hutchinson later told BBC Newsnight it had been a \"difficult\" but \"compelling\" case to work on.\n\"I'm absolutely delighted that the judge has said he has got jurisdiction and that he has gone on to exercise his jurisdiction and make orders.\n\"I'm expecting him [Mr Al-Jeffery,] to comply with the order,\" she said.\nMr Al-Jeffery, who did not attend the case, denied his daughter wanted to return to England or Wales.\nHe said he put up a barrier partition to stop her running away because he was concerned for her welfare, which was taken down on the advice of the authorities.\nHe said he wanted to make sure Ms Al-Jeffery was safe and was not being mistreated.\nNeither Amina nor her father were in court to hear the ruling. And the question now is what difference a ruling in the High Court of England and Wales will make in Saudi Arabia.\nMr Justice Holman said he accepted that there is \"little or nothing\" this court could do to enforce the order if Amina's father was determined not to obey or comply with it.\nCertainly the basis on which it was granted, that Amina has dual British and Saudi nationality, is not recognised in Saudi Arabia. And it is perhaps telling that Mohammed Al-Jeffery's legal costs have been paid for by the Saudi embassy.\nHowever, the judge stated that to do nothing \"would in my view amount to a dereliction towards Amina\".\nThe court was told that in April Mr Al-Jeffery instigated legal proceedings against his daughter in Jeddah \"seeking parental control over his child for the purposes of caring and supervision\".\nLegal documentation showed both father and daughter agreed to a reconciliation.\nBut Mr Justice Holman said that meant if \"she were to run away the police, far from offering her protection from her father, would put her in prison\".\nMr Justice Holman said: \"If Amina chooses to remain voluntarily in Saudi Arabia she must of course adhere to the law and culture of that society but the current constraint is denying to her the ability to be British and to live in Britain.\n\"It is true that she is currently present and habitually resident in Saudi Arabia, but that is due to her obedience to her father in 2012. She did not travel there of her own free will.\"\nHe said Mr Al-Jeffery \"voluntarily chose to live for many years in Wales, to educate and bring his children up here... and to accept the constraints of the legal system of England and Wales\".\nThe judge said the fact Ms Al-Jeffery was born and brought up in Britain until she was almost 17 was a \"very significant factor\" in his decision.\nThe court was told Mr Al-Jeffery's wife, from whom he is not estranged, and several of his children continue to live in the UK.\nSwansea West MP Geraint Davies has written to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to demand immediate action over the case.\nThe former Swansea schoolgirl has been in touch with friends in the UK and asked them to contact the British Embassy to inform them of her situation, and has also sent a picture of what she claimed was the caged room her father had kept her in.\nIn a statement, the Foreign Office said: \"We recognise that this is a distressing time for Ms Al-Jeffery. We have been providing assistance to her since the case was first brought to our attention and will continue to do so.\n\"British embassy staff have met with her to check on her welfare and helped her speak to lawyers in the UK.\"",
