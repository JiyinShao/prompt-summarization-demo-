    "article": "Abuse: Angela Linton wrote a homophobic message directed at one of her son's teachers in the child's pass book . A mother who was banned from her son's school after abusing staff then used one of the child's books to deliver a homophobic tirade to a teacher. Angela Linton wrote the vile message, directed at gay teacher Thomas O'Brien, after a row about a school outing, Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard. The 47-year-old, from Handsworth in Birmingham, has been given a community order, told to carry out unpaid work and fined £185 for harassing the victim. Linton's son started at Perry Beeches secondary school in September last year, the court heard. Helen Shipley, prosecuting, said that Linton approached head of year Mr O'Brien in October and expressed concern that she could not afford to send her son on a forthcoming residential trip. She was told that the school could come to an alternative arrangement, but failed to attend a scheduled meeting and then abused Mr O'Brien over the phone. Miss Shipley said: 'Linton felt that the school, in particular Mr O'Brien, was unfairly targeting her son, who had been placed in detention over having a mobile phone in class.' In another incident, Linton was shouting and acting aggressively outside the school entrance, and was told to leave the premises. School officials then sent the angry mother a letter telling her she was banned, and could only communicate with the school via the assistant headteacher or in her son's pass book. In January, she wrote a message in the book referring to the phone row she had with Mr O'Brien and abusing him for being gay. 'Mr O'Brien said he was traumatised by reading these comments,' Miss Shipley said. 'His sexuality was well known. He said it was something he was comfortable with. 'He could not believe they had been written. He did not know the reason for it.' School: The row began when Linton's son - a pupil at Perry Beeches, pictured - could not afford to go on an outing . Akhmed Yakoob, defending, said Linton felt remorse over her actions, which were out of character. Linton pleaded guilty to displaying writing which caused harassment, alarm or distress, and was sentenced to a 12-month community order. She was also ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid work and to pay £100 compensation to the victim and £85 costs. Chairman of the bench Peter Pratt said: 'There is no doubt whatsoever that you have intentionally caused harassment, alarm or distress, most obviously to Mr O'Brien. 'The virulent language undoubtedly caused Mr O'Brien to be fearful.'",

    "article": "(CNN)Change is coming to Ferguson. In the next few weeks the Department of Justice (DOJ) will begin to negotiate in earnest with the city to restructure the police department, which the department has charged with engaging in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination. It should not be forgotten that the DOJ review of the Ferguson Police Department was precipitated by months of protests and activism following the killing of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer and by revelations about the town's dysfunctional government and court system by local civil rights law groups. Now, after a half year of unrest, and with citizens on Tuesday electing two new black city council members, change is beginning to come to Ferguson. The question is, what kind of change? The report from the Department of Justice offered a devastating insight into a police department and court system that preyed on its own citizens. Through illegal traffic stops and arrests, and the use of excessive force, the police department held town residents in bondage. The municipal court system used excessive court fines and fees to ensure that citizens arrested for even minor infractions would be charged thousands of dollars or face jail time. Court costs and fees constituted the second-largest sources of revenue for the town. Rather than a force for public safety, the Ferguson Police Department became, according to Attorney General Eric Holder, \"a collection agency\" -- one that preyed disproportionately on the town's African-American residents. The evidence of ugly and explicit racial discrimination was devastating. It included blatantly racist emails traded among officers, and evidence that African-Americans were victims in all of the police canine bite incidents recorded by the department. But just a few weeks before the release of the report, the Ferguson police chief declared there were \"no racial issues\" in his department. Ferguson's ugly, racist emails released . The recommendations in the report, ranging from new training and supervision of police officers, addressing racially discriminatory conduct to structural revisions in the court system, will, if implemented, remake the law enforcement system in the town. (A grand jury that investigated the shooting of Brown by Officer Darren Wilson chose not to file charges against him and the Justice Department also didn't find reason to prosecute.) Without question, change is coming to the town's government. Town Manager John Shaw, Ferguson's most powerful official and, until the DOJ's blistering report, the one who inexplicably managed to elude public scrutiny, resigned weeks ago and has been replaced by the city's deputy manager. Three sitting city council members chose not to run for office again and, on Tuesday, citizens elected two black candidates to the city council, changing its racial composition: Five of six members and the mayor were white. Now the council will be 50% black. Ferguson's hapless police Chief Thomas Jackson also finally resigned after holding on through a months-long display of astonishing incompetence. The department first drew the attention of the nation for its display of military weaponry and tear gas in response to civilian protests.  The appointment of a commander from the State Highway Patrol was deemed necessary to begin quelling the unrest and to build community trust in the early days of the protest. Jackson's departure sent an important signal to the population of a town preyed upon by officers under his command. And so we can be certain that along with the new makeup of the city council, there will be a new police chief in Ferguson. But does that mean that fundamental change will come to Ferguson? Not necessarily. Not unless protest and activism during this critical period turns to influence the vitally important opportunities that lie ahead in the coming weeks. The Department of Justice's full-on negotiations with the leadership in Ferguson will determine the shape of the new Ferguson Police Department. Indeed, the DOJ report alludes to the possibility of disbanding the department in favor of a regional policing integration with St. Louis County. Many local activists have suggested just such a solution, but given ongoing problems with policing in the county -- including the role of county forces in some of the most controversial clashes with activists in Ferguson last fall -- community representatives will have to fight hard to ensure that the DOJ can fold St. Louis County Police into its monitoring and reform process. Equally important were the April 7 general elections. Turnout in municipal elections has been notoriously low in Ferguson, with white voters nearly three times more likely to turn out than African-Americans. But local groups had engaged in vigorous voter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns.. The Mayor has two years left to his term and has defiantly insisted that he will not resign (although a petition for his recall has been circulating). That means that he will be a lead voice in negotiating with the DOJ to remake the police department. Has he committed to a clear set of principles that will guide his participation in those talks? Community activists and residents must ensure that Mayor James Knowles plans to represent their vision of new Ferguson Police Department. But there is an opportunity to begin thinking about even more ambitious structural change in Ferguson and throughout St. Louis County. Ferguson's governing structure, with a strong city manager and a weak council and mayor, mirrors that of thousands of other suburbs in the United States. That form of governance might have been precisely what thriving, middle class white suburbanites wanted when they fled racial integration in cities like St. Louis. But working class suburbs like Ferguson with a majority black population in which the needs of the population in the areas of education and economic opportunity more closely hews to the needs of urban residents, may need a more robust form of governance. In any case, a system in which the elected officials have minimal power, but non-elected leaders, like the town manager and the chief of police, have inordinate power, is a recipe for the kind of unaccountable, non-representative government that controlled Ferguson's residents. Yet this precise form of government is in wide use across the country. Likewise, Missouri, like the vast majority of states, holds municipal elections in non-presidential election years, guaranteeing a significantly lower voter turnout -- although only a few states hold the primary and general election in March and April as Missouri law requires Ferguson to do. It's not that Ferguson is so different than towns across America. It's precisely because Ferguson holds up a mirror to flaws in our democratic system of government in towns across this country that the stakes are so high. Ferguson residents now have the opportunity to begin a movement for change in the other 89 jurisdictions in St. Louis County plagued by similar governance flaws, including those towns led by African-Americans. And Ferguson's example should provoke self-examination in working class suburbs across the country, where the power and effectiveness of weak elected local government is inadequate to meet the needs of the population. Change is coming to Ferguson. But the scope and breadth of that change will depend upon the ambition and discipline of activists and residents, whose passion and tenacity have already transformed the trajectory of leadership in a typical American town.",

    "article": "Patrick Bamford enhanced Middlesbrough’s automatic promotion bid by equalling the club’s record goal return of the modern era. Bamford, the on-loan Chelsea forward, struck his 15th of the campaign, to match the tally of Colombian Hamilton Ricard during the 1998-99 Premier League season. No one has scored more in the 16 intervening years. His deflected 20th-minute effort was enough to earn victory over relegation-threatened Wigan, who now have just six matches to avert the prospect of playing League One football just two years after shocking Manchester City in the FA Cup final at Wembley. Middlesbrough striker Patrick Bamford, on loan from Chelsea, scores the opening goal via a deflection . Bamford celebrates his 17th goal of the season, the fourth that he has scored in his last four games . Middlesbrough: Konstantopoulos, Kalas, Woodgate, Gibson, Friend, Clayton, Leadbitter, Reach, Bamford, Adomah, Vossen. Subs: Tiendalli, Amorebieta, Garcia, Tomlin, Ripley, Whitehead, Forshaw. Wigan: Al Habsi, Boyce, Maguire, Pearce, Bong, Pennant, Perch, Kim, McClean, Clarke, Murphy. Subs: Carson, McCann, Ojo, Barnett, Fortune, Waghorn, Kvist Jorgensen. Referee: Stuart Attwell . Despite being five points adrift of safety, the Lancashire club arrived with an impressive away record, having taken 21 of their 35 points away from the DW Stadium and winning their last four games on the road. However, no second-tier side have taken more points on their own turf than Middlesbrough and Bamford made it nine victories in 10 attempts at the Riverside. It was from a classic counter-attack that Aitor Karanka’s team took the lead. A Wigan free-kick invoked panic in the home penalty area as Dimi Konstantopoulos dropped a high ball at the feet of Leon Clarke, whose instinctive prod goalwards then fortuitously struck the Middlesbrough goalkeeper. But Boro seized on the loose ball and within seconds they had scored. Adam Clayton’s pass utilised Albert Adomah’s pace and Boro were lucky when Jelle Vossen’s heavy touch from a right-wing cross set up Bamford. He curled his shot goalward from 20 yards and a slight deflection off Wigan defender Jason Pearce took it beyond the grasp of his goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi. Jonathan Woodgate plays the ball out of defence as Middlesbrough looked in control for long periods . Albert Adomah gets dow the outside of Josh Murphy  as Middlesbrough continued their promotion push . Despite Bamford stealing the limelight, however, Middlesbrough head coach Aitor Karanka praised the effort of his team. ‘It was a very important win and performance, especially second half. The most important thing is to win the games, to rest well and to think about Monday’s game,’ said Karanka. ‘Everything is going to be tighter. Everyone is playing for something. Wigan were playing to stay up and I think in all games someone has something to play for, so every game will be difficult. ‘Everyone was tired after Bournemouth and there were a lot of games in February and March. Now after the break our heads are fresh and we have four games in the next two weeks. ‘We have experienced players and a lot of games coming up now, Monday and Saturday. There are six games to go and we need all of the players. ‘Patrick scored the goal but there were other players who contributed all around the field.’ Bamford is mobbed by his team-mates after the goal that sent Boro back to the top of the league . Malky Mackay's side remain adrift in the relegation zone after a third defeat in their last five games . Wigan pressed hard for an equaliser after the break and it took a strong right hand from Konstantopoulos to keep out substitute Marc-Antoine Fortune’s effort just after the hour. ‘I’m really disappointed that we didn’t get something out of the game,’ said Wigan manager Malky Mackay. ‘We deserved something. ‘Especially in the second half we went toe to toe with Middlesbrough, one of the best teams in the division, and I am disappointed for my players for the courage they showed.’ Adam Clayton brings down James Perch, but Wigan never really threatened to take the points off their hosts . Things got particularly nervy in injury time when Wigan — with four up front — were camped deep in home territory. Boro had their own chances to seal a more comfortable win but Adomah volleyed wide at the climax of a stunning team move and substitute Lee Tomlin, who coame on for Vossen in the 67th minute, failed to get sufficient contact on a close-range effort seconds after entering the action. Tomlin wasted another opportunity deep into injury time when he slalomed his way down the field on a breakaway but his shot came off the heel of covering defender Harry Maguire. But all Boro cared about was the three points.",

    "article": "Wigan Athletic have acted swiftly in finding a replacement for Malky Mackay, making former club captain Gary Caldwell their new manager as the Championship strugglers look to fight off relegation. The 32-year-old, who has been at the DW Stadium since 2010, will take charge for the first time against Fulham at Craven Cottage on Friday. The move to appoint Caldwell comes as a surprise, with the Scot admitting himself that he did not expect to get the job. Wigan Athletic have made club captain Gary Caldwell their new manager on a long-term basis . Caldwell (right) lifted the FA Cup with Wigan in 2013 but now he must lead them out of a relegation scrap . The former Scotland international has made no secret of his intentions to take up coaching in the past . Gary Caldwell, who joined Wigan in 2010 from Celtic and was appointed captain in his first full season at the club. The Scotland international signed a new one-year contract with the club in July last year and was given some coaching responsibilities as part of his new role. On retiring in February after being unable to recover from a hip injury, Caldwell formally joined the academy as a member of coaching staff. Chairman David Sharpe said Caldwell was 'the only candidate we considered'. Mackay was relieved of his duties following Wigan's 2-0 defeat to Derby on Easter Monday, which left them eight points adrift of safety in the Sky Bet Championship table. And the club has moved quickly to replace him, naming Caldwell, who will be assisted by Graham Barrow, as his successor on a permanent contract . 'I've made no secret of the fact that I wanted to move into management when the time was right,' Caldwell said. 'I didn't expect that to come along as quickly as this but, in football, you need to take opportunities when they arise and I am honoured and excited in equal measures to take charge at the Latics, where I have shared such incredible memories over the past five years. Malky Mackay was relieved of his duties after defeat by Derby on Easter Monday, with Wigan struggling . 'We are in a really tough place at the moment, but we will approach the next five games with only one thing in mind, to win. After that, we will assess where we are and move on.' Wigan chairman David Sharpe, who only recently took over from his grandfather Dave Whelan, said the move was made to get an immediate reaction but that the club see Caldwell as their long-term leader. 'After a meeting with him on Monday and discussions all day Tuesday, Gary was the only candidate we considered because we are so convinced of his qualities. Chairman David Sharpe (centre) made it clear that the appointment was part of a long-term strategy . 'People will talk about his lack of experience, but every young coach is in the same place, there are many examples of young coaches being given opportunities and being successful,' he said. 'For me the timing was important; we will look to get a reaction in the next five games and this period crucially gives Gary a chance to look at the players in his way until the end of the season. Plus it enables us to start working now with a manager we know will be in place next season. 'But this is an appointment for the long-term.' Caldwell, who turns 33 on Sunday, will be formally presented at a press conference on Wednesday morning, .",

    "article": "The Avengers have battled to save Earth from an alien invasion, the evil Loki and now, in the latest movie, face off against the killing machine Ultron. They do this, of course, with the help of numerous superpowers - including Iron Man’s suit, super-healing abilities and Captain America’s indestructible shield. But just how scientifically sound are some of these powers, and do any of them hold up to the laws of physics and chemistry as we know them? Scroll down for video . The American Chemical Society in Washington explained the science behind the Avengers in a video. It looks at the composition of Iron Man's suit - said to be a gold-titanium alloy in one of the movies - and Captain America's shield. The video also explains the science behind super-healing abilities . In a video for Reactions, the American Chemical Society took a look at the science of Marvel's Avengers. It begins looking at Tony Stark, better known as Iron Man when he dons his iron suit of armour. His original suit, made only of iron, would have weighed around 70kg (150lbs) according to the ACS - not very comfortable or easy to move around in. He later upgrades it to a gold-titanium alloy, but that would actually make things worse explained the video. ‘That suit would probably weigh around 160kg (350lbs), which might work for the Hulk but not for Tony Stark,’ said the narrator. However, Dr Raychelle Burks continued that it is later made of a nickel-titanium alloy called nitinol. This is ‘strong but light, and can be reformed after taking damage,’ she said. ‘There may also be some graphite reinforced with carbon fibre, which can take a lot of heat - useful if Iron Man doesn’t want to singe his feet using those rocket boots.’ Tony Stark, better known as Iron Man when he dons his iron suit of armour and played by Robert Downey Jnr (pictured), made his original suit out of iron. He later upgrades it to a gold-titanium alloy, but according to the ACS that would be heavy and uncomfortable - perhaps better for the Hulk than Iron Man himself . None of this would work, though, without Stark’s own portable nuclear power station - the Arc Reactor. In Iron Man 2 this uses palladium - but we soon learn this is poisoning and killing the character. So instead, he creates a new element - and Dr Burks said this might not be as far-fetched as it seems. He uses his own particle accelerator to smash the nuclei of atoms together and make a new type of atom, which is not entirely dissimilar to the experiments taking place at real-life accelerators such as Cern. ‘Scientists have made 20 synthetic elements this way, so it’s not unbelievable that Stark would have made new elements to power his suit,’ said Dr Burks. The main skeleton of Raytheon;s exoskeleton, shown, is made from high-strength aluminium and steel, and weighs about 95kg (209lb) Iron Man’s superpowers don’t stem from a radioactive spider bite or exposure to gamma rays; they are simply the result of some very clever engineering - and quite a bit of money too. It makes sense then that we should try to replicate his powerful suit, and some companies are already coming incredibly close. Raytheon, an American defence contractor, has developed a super-strong robotic exoskeleton for the US Army. Soldiers can simply strap into the suit and its high-pressure hydraulic system will enhance their strength, agility and endurance, enabling them to be extremely physically active without risk of exhaustion or injury. The current version must be tethered to its power source, an internal combustion hydraulics engine, but an untethered version is expected to be operational by 2020. It’s not just the military that can benefit from exoskeletons, though, as Lockheed Martin has also designed a suit specifically to help workers operate heavy machinery. The Fortis helps to carry the weight of tools, enabling the operator to work for longer between breaks required to recover from muscle fatigue. Source: How It Works issue 72, 'Real-life superpowers' Tony Stark's suit is powered by his famous Arc Reactor, but in Iron Man 2, we learn that its palladium fuel source is slowly killing him. So instead, Stark creates a new element - and this might not be as far-fetched as it seems as it follows somewhat similar principles to those taking place at Cern . Stark isn’t the only one with super-human abilities, though. Both Captain America and Black Widow have super strength, quick reflexes - and, most interestingly - the ability to heal quickly. ‘In normal healing, a type of white blood cell called a macrophage fights infections and oversees the repair process,’ explains Dr Burks. While this can take two to five days in regular humans, the macrophages of Captain American and Black Widow appear to be super productive, helping them heal even more quickly. Both Captain America (left) and Black Widow (right) have super strength and quick reflexes, while and - most interestingly - the ability to heal  quickly. This could be due to having advanced macrophages, which let them fight infections and repair their bodies much quicker than us regular humans . And Captain America also has his shield as protection, which can deflect bullets, grenades, lasers and so on. Most of its protection appears to come from steel, although this is not a great shock absorber - and somehow Captain America is able to survive even the heaviest of blows from Thor’s hammer. The reason is thanks to the imaginary mineral called vibranium which, while fictional, has some science at its core. Captain America also has his shield as protection, which can deflect bullets, grenades, lasers and so on. The reason is thanks to the imaginary mineral called vibranium - which, while fictional, has some science at its core. It appears that this material can turn vibrational energy from an impact into light energy . ‘This material can absorb a near infinite amount of vibration energy without getting too hot or melting,’ explains Dr Burks. As evidenced by a flash of light as Thor’s hammer hits the shield, it appears this material can ‘convert vibrational energy to light energy,’ keeping the Captain safe. Of course, you have to suspend disbelief just a bit to assume this is possible - but perhaps the Avengers have more of a root in science than you thought.",

    "article": "(CNN)Atop the Amazon bestselling books list this month sat an unexpected title: \"Secret Garden.\" It wasn't Frances Hodgson Burnett's 1911 novel about a sour little girl's magical place, making a book club comeback. It was a similarly named coloring book that adults were buying, for themselves, and it wasn't the only one in the top 10. Johanna Basford's \"Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure Hunt & Coloring Book\" (now at No. 3 on Amazon) along with her second effort, \"Enchanted Forest: An Inky Quest & Coloring Book\" (No. 6); \"Balance (Angie's Extreme Stress Menders Volume 1)\" by Angie Grace (No. 9); and \"The Mindfulness Colouring Book: Anti-stress Art Therapy for Busy People\" by Emma Farrarons (No. 8 on Amazon UK) are selling at a rapid clip. Though they can be used by kids, these and other new coloring book titles are being marketed to stressed-out, work-addled adults, who want to benefit from the quiet zen that a coloring session can bring. \"Adult coloring is absolutely a growing trend and consumers are really taking to the idea,\" Farrarons' U.S. publisher, Matthew Lore of The Experiment publishing group, wrote in an email. \"Not only is it calming and good for your health, it's just fun! The demand is increasing exponentially as the word spreads.\" While Farrarons and Basford are based in the UK, the concept is taking off in the U.S. too, with the publication of titles like Virginia-based art therapist Lacy Mucklow and illustrator Angela Porter's \"Color Me Calm\" and \"Color Me Happy,\" created for the minds and motor skills of Mom and Dad, not the kids. The trend doesn't seem to be letting up. Basford is working on a third title, Farrarons has been commissioned for a second book, and Mucklow and Porter will release \"Color Me Stress-Free\" in September. Adults have long used crafts to unwind, but why coloring books? Why now? It may have something to do with online access -- and, funnily enough, the desire to unplug. Ordering a coloring book that suits adult tastes online is easier than walking into a bookstore where the only options have Barbie or Thomas the Tank Engine themes. Plus, everyone's favorite online crafting hub, Pinterest, is a treasure trove of adult coloring pages, with themes ranging from nature and animals to classic paintings. Meanwhile, like children, adults need a break from screen time -- and many are rediscovering the analog pleasures of coloring inside the lines. \"I'm a grown-up, but I still love coloring books,\" novelist Matt Cain proclaimed in a piece for The Guardian. \"If I switch off the phone, computer and TV and concentrate solely on choosing the right shade of blue, avoiding going over the lines and slowly filling up my page with colour, all my other concerns, I've discovered, fade to nothing,\" Cain wrote. The therapeutic benefits of art are nothing new; it's a concept that practitioners use with patients of all ages. Atlanta-based art therapist Susanne Fincher, who has published several coloring books, said coloring can lift the mood, reduce anxiety and relieve stress. \"Art making is a powerful intervention,\" Fincher wrote in an email. \"Neuroscientific research has shown that through the use of art therapy, the human brain can physically change, grow, and rejuvenate.\" True art therapy, she warned, should be administered only by a qualified professional. Mindfulness and meditative coloring are recurring themes in the growing adult coloring book industry. A search for \"adult coloring books\" on Amazon or Barnes and Noble will yield several books of mandalas, a ritual symbol in Buddhism and Hinduism that represents the universe, waiting to be colored in. \"I sometimes give clients one of my mandala coloring books for homework between sessions with me,\" Fincher wrote. \"Coloring mandalas can empower a client to manage thoughts and feelings on their own with the positive activity of coloring, instead of, for example, overeating or abusing substances.\" The opportunity to craft a mindfulness coloring book for adults was serendipitous for illustrator Farrarons, who had been practicing mindfulness for a few years before getting the offer to create a book. \"In mindfulness, it is encouraged to break patterns in life by introducing variation to avoid the sensation of being on autopilot,\" Farrarons wrote in an email while on holiday in Korea. \"Each page has been caringly designed with this in mind, so that the person coloring can hop at random from one pattern to the next. \" Coloring books like Farrarons' pocket-sized volume bring a bit of calming and spirituality to the masses, but for some adult enthusiasts coloring is just a fun throwback to a simpler time, she added. \"It reminds me of hours spent filling in scenes from a coloring book as a little girl. In the digital age that we are in, surely, it can only be a good thing to pick up a pencil and feel young again.\"",

    "article": "(CNN)Anthony Ray Hinton is thankful to be free after nearly 30 years on Alabama's death row for murders he says he didn't commit. And incredulous that it took so long. Hinton, 58, looked up, took in the sunshine and thanked God and his lawyers Friday morning outside the county jail in Birmingham, minutes after taking his first steps as a free man since 1985. He spoke of unjustly losing three decades of his life, under fear of execution, for something he didn't do. \"All they had to do was to test the gun, but when you think you're high and mighty and you're above the law, you don't have to answer to nobody,\" Hinton told reporters. \"But I've got news for you -- everybody that played a part in sending me to death row, you will answer to God.\" Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge Laura Petro had ordered Hinton released after granting the state's motion to dismiss charges against him. Hinton was convicted of murder in the 1985 deaths of two Birmingham-area, fast-food restaurant managers, John Davidson and Thomas Wayne Vason. But a new trial was ordered in 2014 after firearms experts testified 12 years earlier that the revolver Hinton was said to have used in the crimes could not be matched to evidence in either case, and the two killings couldn't be linked to each other. \"Death Row Stories\": Hard questions about the U.S. capital punishment system . The state then declined to re-prosecute the case. Hinton was 29 at the time of the killings and had always maintained his innocence, said the Equal Justice Initiative, a group that helped win his release. \"Race, poverty, inadequate legal assistance, and prosecutorial indifference to innocence conspired to create a textbook example of injustice,\" Bryan Stevenson, the group's executive director and Hinton's lead attorney, said of his African-American client. \"I can't think of a case that more urgently dramatizes the need for reform than what has happened to Anthony Ray Hinton.\" Stevenson said the \"refusal of state prosecutors to re-examine this case despite persuasive and reliable evidence of innocence is disappointing and troubling.\" Amnesty report: Executions down but death sentences on the rise . Dressed in a dark suit and blue shirt, Hinton praised God for his release, saying he was sent \"not just a lawyer, but the best lawyers.\" He said he will continue to pray for the families of the murder victims. Both he and those families have suffered a miscarriage of justice, he said. \"For all of us that say that we believe in justice, this is the case to start showing, because I shouldn't have (sat) on death row for 30 years,\" he said. Woman who spent 22 years on death row has case tossed . Hinton was accompanied Friday by two of his sisters, one of whom still lives in the Birmingham area. Other siblings will fly to the area to see him soon, Stevenson said. His mother, with whom he lived at the time of his arrest, is no longer living, according to the lawyer. Hinton planned to spend at least this weekend at the home of a close friend. He will meet with his attorneys Monday to start planning for his immediate needs, such as obtaining identification and getting a health checkup, Stevenson said. The plan now is to spend a few weeks to get oriented with freedom and \"sort out what he wants to do,\" Stevenson said.",

    "article": "For talented youth team strikers fighting for their big break in the game, goals really are the best currency to convert into those precious first-team minutes. And after extraordinary seasons in which they have both smashed the 35-goal mark, Chelsea's teenage strike duo Tammy Abraham and Dominic Solanke are certainly flush at the moment. The two 17-year-olds are in the form of their young lives, enhancing their reputations every time they find the net and boosting their chances of Jose Mourinho handing them some game time once the Premier League title has been secured. Tammy Abraham scores for Chelsea during their 3-1 FA Youth Cup final first leg win against Manchester City . Striker Dominic Solanke celebrates after scoring Chelsea's third goal at the Academy Stadium on Monday . And after the Portuguese manager said his first-team squad had space for 'three or four kids' next season, there is every incentive to keep scoring. The latest victim of their remarkable goalscoring spree was Manchester City in the first leg of the FA Youth Cup final on Monday night. Chelsea will take a commanding 3-1 lead into the second leg at Stamford Bridge after Abraham's double - which took his tally to 36 for the season - was added to late on by Solanke, who has now reached 35. The Blues have consciously tried to recruit talented young players from the London area and Camberwell-born Abraham, who joined the club in the under eights, is a success story of this policy. By any standards, he has enjoyed an exceptional season and one that has featured numerous milestones in his development. Most striking has been the sheer volume of goals for the under 18 team, who finished 10 points clear at the top of the southern section of the Premier League at that age group, and are currently competing in the play-off round. Abraham is top scorer in the whole competition with 22 goals. Solanke (No 9) celebrates with Abraham after the latter's second goal of the night and 36th this season . Solanke, pictured scoring against City, could play for the first-team against Arsenal this weekend . Highlights included back-to-back hat-tricks in away matches with Tottenham (which ended in 4-2 and 6-4 wins), plus four goals during Chelsea's run to success in the UEFA Youth League, the continental competition for under 19 teams. This campaign has also seen a scoring debut for Chelsea's under 21 side and a first involvement with the England youth set-up. It has been the kind of scoring sequence where pretty much anything struck seems to fly into the top corner and that was the case for Abraham's first goal against City. Controlling Charlie Colkett's excellent ball over the top to allow it to run across his body, he sent his shot spearing into the top corner. It was a moment that drew considerable attention on Twitter. Little wonder the dreadlocked frontman described 'scoring goals as the best feeling ever' in an interview after the match. His second goal showed the sort of instinct all successful strikers need, positioning himself on the edge of City's six-yard box to hook the ball home after the goalkeeper had blocked an initial header from Izzy Brown. Abraham (right) poses with team-mates Charly Musonda and Izzy Brown (L-R) after winning the Youth League . Solanke trains regularly with Chelsea's first-team and made his senior debut against Maribor this season . Another strength is his ability to play across the forward line, on either flank or as a central targetman. On Monday, he started on the right, with Solanke as the No 9 and Izzy Brown on the other side. When asked about it, Abraham showed a studious nature when it comes to watching the game: 'Over the years you see how people have to change their positions in games and it's a good thing if you can adapt.' Solanke is a more familiar name to not only followers of Chelsea but football fans in general. He has been part of Mourinho's first-team squad all season alongside Brown, 18, and the midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek, 19. They train daily with the first team and Solanke made his professional debut when he replaced Oscar for the final 20 minutes of a Champions League match with Maribor back in October. He seems well-suited to the continental stage, as shown by the tournament-best 12 goals he scored as Chelsea became the first English side to lift the Youth League after beating Shakhtar Donetsk in Nyon, Switzerland last week. Solanke scored in every round in that competition and has now done likewise in the Youth Cup, a competition he won when Chelsea beat Fulham in last season's final. Abraham acrobatically puts Chelsea 2-1 ahead against Manchester City after Isaac Buckley's equaliser . Solanke scores Chelsea's second goal in their 3-2 win over Shakhtar Donetsk in the UEFA Youth League final . By his standards, it was a quiet night against City but when his chance came in the closing minutes, he made no mistake and scored a potentially tie-killing third. With Diego Costa out injured and Loic Remy and Didier Drogba doubtful, there is a chance Solanke will play against Arsenal in the Premier League this weekend. His performances this season, which has also seen him elevated to England Under 18 standard, mean he is no longer an unknown quantity but any first-team action between now and the close of the campaign will be valuable. Solanke is calm about his future but certainly not complacent. He said after the Youth League success: 'It's a tough task at Chelsea to get into the first team but you've just got to keep working and see what happens. 'You've got to keep trying to improve and impress and who knows what happens in the future.' Like Abraham, he is certainly making a compelling case at the moment.",

But if there is one phase transition in which food can become frustrating – by giving us brain freeze and by getting painfully stuck to our mouths – then it is when it is frozen. As a fly – perhaps the creature you would least expect to be in this position – found out when it swooped in to have a lick of a frozen beef steak. The fly is initially featured looking rather pleased as it fastens its tongue onto the beef steak and has a taste . Like the infamous scene from Dumb and Dumber involving ice, a ski lift and a tongue, the fly becomes attached to the frozen food. Videoed up-close, the fly is initially captured enjoying itself as it fastens its big tongue onto the beef steak and has a taste. Satisfied, it then goes to fly away home when suddenly it notices that it is stuck and a sense of panic sets in. Realising that its tongue is stuck to the frozen beef steak, the fly begins squirming in its attempts to break free . Moving its legs, the fly at first attempts to walk away, before arching its back and trying with all its might to pull itself free. It tries this two more times, but much to its annoyance it stays attached to the beef steak as it stops to look at the camera. As the video goes on the fly tries harder and harder to set itself free – beating its legs, heaving itself backwards and twisting slightly. The fly tries hard to set itself free by beating its legs, heaving itself backwards and twisting slightly . But nothing seems to work and as it slumps, looking sorry for itself, all appears to have been lost. Luckily for the fly however, help emerges in the form of a human thumb, which attempts to set it free with a little prod. Failing this, the video maker then picks up a little heat gun and begins thawing out the ice around the fly and ultimately setting it free. The video was recorded in Auckland, New Zealand. The fly appears to give up hope but eventually the video maker intervenes and sets the creature free .",

    "article": "Is this the world’s safest bike? Its designers certainly think so. Boasting front and rear lights, rear view mirrors and even a car horn, the team behind the electric Babel Bike say it is unprecedented in its approach to safety. And perhaps most noticeable of all is the roll cage that surrounds the cyclist - keeping them safe against trucks and buses turning into them. Scroll down for video . London-based designer claims to have made the world's safest bike. Called the Babel Bike it has a host of features including a roll cage. Crispin Sinclair (shown with the bike) is seeking £50,000 of funding on site Indiegogo. The bike also has foot protectors and an electric motor . The Babel Bike was designed by London-based Crispin Sinclair - son of the famous British inventor Sir Clive Sinclair, whose 1985 Sinclair C5 bike turned out to be somewhat of a flop. Crispin will be hoping a similar fate does not befall his invention though - and hopes the array of safety features will appeal to safety-conscious cyclists. He is seeking £50,000 ($74,000) of funding on Indiegogo to bring his dream to fruition. The price might be a bit much for some, with the non-electric version retailing for £2,499 ($3,693), and the full electric version £3,499 ($5,170). Both are £500 ($740) less if bought through Indiegogo. May 2016 is the estimated delivery date for the bike at the moment. The bike has a small wheel at the front and a larger one on the back, with a lockable white bar connecting them that doubles as storage for the bike’s innards. It doesn’t rely on pedal power alone, but rather has an electric motor inside that assists it at speeds of up to 20mph in the US and 15.5mph in the EU. ‘In both the US and the EU you can still pedal faster but in both jurisdictions the motor can’t assist at higher speeds (by law),’ the team notes on their Indiegogo page. The bike has a small wheel at the front and a larger one on the back, with a lockable white bar connecting them that doubles as storage for the bike’s innards . There is a holder for a smartphone on the front so you can keep track of vital stats . The controls for the Shimano 250-watt electric assist motor are located on the handlebars, and provide up to 50 per cent assistance. The battery has a range of 50 to 80 miles (80 to 130km). The bike is recharged by either removing the battery and recharging it at home, or with an optional electric-car-charging lead. At the front of the bike are two steel foot protectors, which are detachable and can also be used as a bike lock. The Babel Bike was designed by London-based Crispin Sinclair - son of the famous British inventor Sir Clive Sinclair, whose 1985 Sinclair C5 bike (pictured with Clive in it) turned out to be somewhat of a flop . At the front of the bike are two steel foot protectors, pictured here, which are detachable and can also be used as a bike lock . The bike doesn’t rely on pedal power alone, but rather has an electric motor inside that assists it at speeds of up to 20mph in the US and 15.5mph in the EU. ‘In both the US and the EU you can still pedal faster but in both jurisdictions the motor can’t assist at higher speeds (by law),’ the team notes on their Indiegogo page . But Crispin notes in a video that even all these safety features ‘won’t help in a collision with a turning bus or truck at a junction - by far the single biggest cause of cycling fatalities.’ Transport for London says that 65 per cent of all bike fatalities in London are caused by trucks and buses cutting across cyclists. So the team designed a roll cage for the bike, which prevents it getting trapped under a vehicle. If a truck or bus comes into contact with the bike, it will hit the roll cage first and ensure the cyclist is pushed to relative safety – or at least, that’s the plan. The side of the seat – also detachable – has foam pads to cushion against side impacts, while the shape has apparently being designed with aerodynamics in mind by former Red Bull F1 engineers. ‘Our dream is to put a million more cyclists on our roads, and therefore take a million cars off them, and to do that we need to give cyclists their safety back,’ said Crispin. Whether the bike will prove to be more of a success than his father’s invention remains to be seen, though.",

    "article": "A pair of British expats say they are ‘trapped’ in southern Spain amid an ongoing legal battle with the local town hall over a luxury bed and breakfast they once operated. Patrick and Valerie Jubb are attempting to sell the four-bedroom property where they currently reside in Jimena de la Frontera, but it is now on the brink of being torn down. The retired couple told Spain’s Olive Press news website that they have done nothing wrong but face losing the estate over illegal additions made by a previous owner. Patrick and Valerie Jubb are locked in a dispute with the town hall over alterations made by a previous owner . The Jubbs purchased the bed and breakfast in Jimena de la Frontera, in southern Spain, in 2008 . Patrick, 64, told the news website: ‘We are in absolute pieces over this. ‘All we want is to go back to the UK to be with our family and friends, but we can’t. All our money is tied up in the property.’ Patrick, a former engineer from London, and his 63-year-old wife, Valerie, bought the bed and breakfast, La Vina de Linan, in 2008 and closed it a year ago as they moved forward with plans to sell it. They said they had a deal in place to sell the estate for €680,000, but the town hall ruled that the first floor, kitchen and pool were illegally built by previous owners in 1994. The Jubbs said they obtained a certificate that stated there were no infractions when they bought the estate . When the Jubbs tried to sell the town hall ruled that the alterations, including a swimming pool, were illegal . The Jubbs told the Olive Press that the Junta provided a certificate stating there were no planning infractions when they bought the property, and that the alterations were legalised by land registry officials in 2005 – three years before they acquired the estate. In most situations the local authority loses the right to demolish a house that has been illegally altered if it fails to detect the alterations within four years. But in the case of the Jubbs the usual rule does not apply because the property is located inside Los Alcornocales Natural Park in the Andalusian province of Cadiz. Patrick and Valerie Jubb are planning to move back to the UK, but said their money is tied up in the property . Patrick said the alterations never should have been approved in the first place. Online adverts still list the Jubbs’ property for sale, with a guide price of €875,000. With a sparkling rating on TripAdvisor, it is marketed as a secluded and private property with panoramic mountain views. It is located just 25 minutes from Gibraltar and 90 minutes from Malaga airport. The home boasts four en-suite bedrooms, a large sitting room with a fireplace, a dining room and terraces.",

The former Tory party chairman said that unlike major figures such as Sir Winston Churchill, Clement Attlee or Aneurin Bevan, Mr Cameron had never had a ‘proper job’. Instead, he said the Prime Minister had done nothing except be a special adviser and working in PR for Carlton Television. Lord Tebbit, pictured, launched an astonishing attack on David Cameron claiming the PM has never had a proper job before entering politics unlike Winston Churchill, Clement Attlee or even Aneurin Bevan . Lord Tebbit, a former airline pilot, also criticised Mr Cameron’s tactics in playing up the threat of a Labour-SNP government, and even suggested Tory voters north of the border vote tactically for Labour. He told the BBC’s Newsnight: ‘I just cannot read Mr Cameron’s mind. It’s a foreign country to me. ‘Men like Churchill, Atlee, Bevan, were real men with real depths of experience. ‘They had not gone from school to university to being a special adviser to working in an advertising agency.’ He added: ‘He doesn’t have that hinterland of experience any more than Mr Miliband.’ Lord Tebbit also suggested that Mr Cameron’s campaign tactics were pushing people into the arms of the SNP and Ukip. Lord Tebbit accused Mr Cameron, pictured, of bungling the Scottish referendum and annoying English voters . ‘Having bungled the Scottish referendum, it seems pointless to just irritate Scots by shouting at them from Westminster,’ the former Cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher said. ‘The English are irritated into voting for Ukip, by being shouted at from Westminster – and the Scots are irritated similarly.’ Lord Tebbit also told The Guardian it was ‘logical’ for Scots to vote tactically for Labour in areas where Conservative candidates stand no chance. ‘From the Tories’ point of view we are not going to come home with a vast number of seats from Scotland,’ he said. ‘We know that. ‘So the choice is would we rather have a Scot Nat or Labour? I think, on balance, probably a Labour MP would be a more reasonable thing to have.’ Meanwhile Madonna was criticised by her gay fanbase yesterday for paying ‘unapologetic’ tribute to Margaret Thatcher – who brought in legislation to ban the ‘promotion’ of homosexuality. The 56-year-old singer posted an image of the Iron Lady on photo-sharing website Instagram along with the caption ‘Thank you Margaret Thatcher’ followed by ‘unapologetic’ and a reference to her latest album, Rebel Heart. But the post was hurriedly removed after her gay fans reminded her that Mrs Thatcher’s ‘anti-gay’ legislation was only overturned in 2003.",

They were originally fined £120 for the unauthorised absence from Sweyne Park School in Rayleigh, Essex, after being convicted in November 2014 of failing to ensure their child regularly attended school.

A couple who took their 14-year-old son out of Sweyne Park School in Essex without permission for a five-day holiday to Spain were forced to pay a £1,230 fine after bailiffs were called in . The boy’s grandmother, from Benfleet, Essex, paid up to stop the bailiffs taking property to cover the amount owed. The grandmother, who asked not to be named, said: ‘The bailiff informed me that if the eye-watering fine of £1,230 wasn’t paid immediately they would force entry.’ They told her goods would be sold to cover £3,500 for the fine and charges and the parents would be jailed for three months. She added:  'He's a bright boy, my grandson, and he could easily hack five days off. 'He had never been in an aeroplane and my daughter wanted him to have the experience.

It was a bit Stasi.’ An Essex County Council spokesman said parents legally had to ensure attendance. They added: 'Where there is concern for a child's attendance, schools will work with the family to address the cause of the absence. 'The amendment in legislation in September 2013 made it clear that head teachers should not grant any leave of absence during term time unless there are exceptional circumstances.'",

    "article": "In a quest to be more green, Apple says it is investing in Chinese solar power and preserving American forests that make environmentally friendly paper. The tech giant announced a new focus on using paper from trees harvested under environmentally sound conditions. As part of the deal, Apple has pledged an unspecified amount of money for a Virginia-based nonprofit, the Conservation Fund, to purchase two large tracts of timberland on the East Coast. Then EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, now Apple's president for environmental initiatives, has spearheaded the new green focus at the world's biggest company. Apple pledged an unspecified amount of money for a Virginia-based nonprofit, the Conservation Fund, to purchase two large tracts of timberland on the East Coast. In the Reed Forest of Aroostook County, Maine, wetlands, rivers, and upland forest provide refuge for Atlantic salmon, bald eagle, and Canada lynx. In Brunswick Forest located in southern North Carolina, the high-quality pine savannas and unique plants and flowers have long made this land a conservation priority. The Conservation Fund will resell the land to commercial interests under legally binding terms that require future owners to preserve the forest and follow environmentally sound principles for cutting and replanting trees. The initiatives come as the tech giant this year met a self-imposed goal of powering all its U.S. operations with renewable energy to reduce carbon emissions — initiatives that have won high marks from environmental groups. On Thursday,  It's also promising to use more renewable power overseas, where Apple relies heavily on contract manufacturers — and where a top executive acknowledged the company can do more. 'It's important to us to tackle climate change everywhere we are,' Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president for environmental initiatives, told The Associated Press. 'When you talk about China, you're talking about manufacturing partners. 'We're looking to bring the same innovation there. 'This is the start.' The new solar project in China has a capacity of 40 megawatts, which is smaller than some projects Apple has announced in the United States. By comparison, Apple is spending $850 million for rights to nearly half the output of a 280-megawatt solar facility planned for construction south of Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters. That project will produce enough energy to power all of Apple's California offices, a computer center and 52 retail stores. Still, the Chinese project will produce more than the amount of energy consumed by Apple's 19 corporate offices and 21 retail stores in China and Hong Kong, Jackson said. She added that Apple uses renewable energy for 87 percent of the power at its facilities worldwide. That figure, however, doesn't include substantial power consumption by contract manufacturers. With the new project in China, Apple is looking to improve its own operations first. 'Before we go somewhere else and start asking and eventually requiring clean energy, you want to make sure you show folks how to do it,' said Jackson, who was U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator during President Barack Obama's first term. Apple and other tech companies have drawn criticism in the past for use of toxics in manufacturing and data centers powered by electricity from coal. But Apple's moves away from those practices in recent years have won accolades from groups like Greenpeace, which issued a statement praising the Chinese project Thursday. Jackson declined to say how much Apple is investing in the Chinese project, which is being built in partnership with U.S. energy company SunPower and four Chinese firms. Although China is known for heavy reliance on coal, its government has set aggressive goals for solar, wind and hydroelectric power. Meanwhile, Apple pledged an unspecified amount of money for a Virginia-based nonprofit, the Conservation Fund, to purchase two large tracts of timberland on the East Coast. The Conservation Fund will resell the land — 36,000 acres of timberland in Maine and North Carolina — to commercial interests under legally binding terms that require future owners to preserve the forest and follow environmentally sound principles for cutting and replanting trees. Larry Selzer, the group's chief executive, said that will protect the forest while keeping it in the hands of private owners who pay taxes and create jobs. The Conservation Fund will resell the land — 36,000 acres of timberland in Maine and North Carolina — to commercial interests under legally binding terms that require future owners to preserve the forest and follow environmentally sound principles for cutting and replanting trees. Selzer said he'll use proceeds from reselling the land to buy and protect additional tracts. 'Apple believes that paper, like energy, can be a renewable resource,' the pair said in a blog post announceing the deal. 'So Apple is striving to supply 100 percent of the virgin fibers used in its paper and packaging from sustainably managed forests or controlled wood sources. ' Apple won't necessarily buy paper made from trees on that land, but Jackson said the investment will increase the supply of sustainable wood fiber. She said the two tracts would produce about half the non-recycled wood fiber used in Apple's product packaging last year. That would put Apple halfway toward its goal of obtaining all its non-recycled paper products from sustainable timber. Apple wouldn't say how much paper it uses, but it says two-thirds of its paper packaging comes from recycled material. In the last three months of 2014, Apple sold more than 100 million iPhones and other gadgets, most in cardboard boxes. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

A new poll by YouGov ahead of Charles and Camilla's 10th wedding anniversary reveals that 49 per cent think Camilla should take the traditional title of the wife of a reigning king, while 35 per cent believe she should be given a lesser title out of respect to Diana, Princess of Wales and 16 per cent were undecided. When the Prince and Camilla became engaged in February 2005, only 7 per cent of people polled by YouGov thought Camilla should one day be Queen. Scroll down for video . Almost half of all Britons believe Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, right, should become Queen when Prince Charles accedes to the throne although 35 per cent believe she should be rewarded with a lesser title . Half of those polled believe that Camilla, right, does a good job of carrying out her official duties . Aides have always insisted the Duchess does not want to be known as Queen and intends to be known as Princess Consort instead. But according to some legal experts, unless there is change in the law, Camilla will technically become Queen no matter what title she actually uses. Most people (42 per cent) said they had neither a positive or negative impression of Camilla, with 31 per cent saying they had a positive one and 23 per cent a negative one. But the survey of 1,830 people also showed that 44 per cent believed Camilla was well prepared to be the wife of the reigning monarch, 13 per cent thought she was badly prepared and the remainder had no opinion or did not know. Of those questioned, 50 per cent thought Camilla had carried out her duties as Duchess of Cornwall well - with 20 per cent saying she did this very well and 30 per cent fairly well. Only 6 per cent thought she had done badly in the role. Some 28 per cent had no opinion and 16 per cent did not know. Nicola Wildash, research executive at YouGov, suggested it was more a case of people becoming used to Camilla, rather than a large surge in popularity. 'The further we get from Diana's death, the less that will resonate in people's minds. As soon as the public see something for years and years, they become more neutralised to the issue,' she said. Prince Charles, left, and Camilla, right, are preparing to celebrate their tenth wedding anniversary . Figures from YouGov in June last year showed 53 per cent thought Camilla should one day become Queen Consort, 32 per cent believed she should have a lesser title and 14 per cent did not know. But Ms Wildash said the slight decrease from 53 per cent to 49 per cent was not significant and part of a general small fluctuation. Almost two fifths (39 per cent) said they believed the Queen was happy with Camilla's performance as the Duchess of Cornwall, with only 9 per cent thinking the monarch was unhappy. Regarding Charles, 29 per cent think he is performing his duties as Prince of Wales better than he did 10 years ago, while 7 per cent think he is performing his duties worse than a decade ago. But 27 per cent think he was already performing his duties well and there has been no difference during the 10 years and 12 per cent believe there is no difference and he is still performing his duties poorly.",

    "article": "Green party leader Natalie Bennett has been forced to distance herself from a bizarre online site run by her boyfriend. Jim Jepps used a blog called The Daily Maybe to defend 'rape fantasies', describe paedophiles as 'complex human beings' and question why teachers who have relationships with pupils are put on the sex offenders register. The couple met five years ago when Ms Bennett contacted him to correct something he had written about her, but now the Green party stresses they do not 'want to be associated' with his internet rants. Scroll down for video . Green party leader Natalie Bennett has distanced herself from the bizarre blog posts of her boyfriend Jim Jepps, insisting he is a 'private individual not involved in party politics' Ms Bennett's profile has soared in recent months, buoyed by rising poll ratings and Green party membership in England passing 60,000 for the first time. However, little is known about her private life, in contrast to the spouses of David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg who have been frequently seen on the campaign trail. Ms Bennett has been dating Mr Jepps for five years, after meeting online. He continued blogging on the Daily Maybe site until 2011. He quit the Socialist Workers Party in around 2003 and later joined the Greens. Bizarrely, he left the party in 2012, the year Ms Bennett replaced the more high-profile Caroline Lucas as Green leader. On his website, Mr Jepps appears to have deliberately courted controversy with a series of controversial blog posts, often related to sex, rape or paedophiles. In one post, seen by MailOnline, he joked that gay sex is not a sin 'unless you do it really well or claim it on expenses'. In 2007, he tackled a news story about demands for music books written by a paedophile to be withdrawn, because the recorder lessons were used to groom victims. Mr Jepps wrote: 'We can burn these books as a public statement against the author (who is in jail for his crimes) or try to understand that whatever monstrous acts individuals commit they are still complex human beings for all that. 'Good, evil, interesting and banal by turns - not devils who can taint everything they touch with evil.' He also dismissed a case in which a blogger was charged with obscenity for writing an article imagining the kidnap and murder of the pop group Girls Aloud. 'Either I'm hopelessly jaded or getting depraved and corrupted is a lot duller than I remember… Personally I didn't find it that shocking.' Mr Jepps quit the Green party in 2012, the same year Ms Bennett became leader after replacing Caroline Lucas (left) According to the Sunday Mirror another posting included: 'New Poll: Sex with pupils - good idea/bad idea? Personally I'm ambivalent and would appreciate any guidance. 'It seems to me the sex offenders register is a sledgehammer to crack a nut sometimes.

    "article": "Top marks for Saskia, the girlfriend of an Arsenal fan who aced a written exam on all things Gunners to save their relationship and whose mostly correct responses have gone viral. Saskia, 17, whose username is @saskiaisabxlla, posted excerpts of the exam on Monday with the message ‘Boyfriend made me take an @Arsenal exam.’ For Saskia (surname withheld), the stakes were high before she scored 43.5 out of a possible 50 points, or 87 per cent. By the grading system of her boyfriend, who didn’t want to be identified, that constitutes an A. Saskia, 17, aced the 'Arsenal exam' given by her boyfriend with a score of 43.5 out of 50 or 87 per cent . ‘Well done, Saskia. As a result, I will not be dumping you [lucky you],’ he wrote in red pen on the cover of the test along with some feedback. The post has since been retweeted 9,600 times, almost five times for each of her 1,900 or so followers, with widespread congratulations coming from Gunners fans. ‘Could have performed better in Q17,’ a question in which she was asked to explain ‘why Alexis Sanchez is better than Eden Hazard.’ Her responses included ‘Sanchez is buff’ and that ‘he scores a lot of goals’. A derogatory comment about Hazard, the newly crowned PFA Player of the Year, got extra marks. She told Sportsmail: 'After the Arsenal vs Chelsea game the previous Sunday, he told me \"I might make make an Arsenal exam for you\". At first I thought he was joking but then I thought it would be funny to do it. 'Over the time that we have been together I managed to adopt his interest and learnt a lot about football in the process. So the following day I took it under his watch to make sure I didn't cheat. He marked it based on his own grade boundaries and I did better than he expected. 'I tweeted it the same evening, but we never expected it to get this far. I've had mixed reception but most of it was positive, some even calling him a \"legend\". He said that our relationship was on the line but he was bluffing and used it as a tool to motivate me. 'A few took it too seriously but at the end of the day it was just something that we did together for fun and was meant to be humorous and lighthearted.' Saskia correctly identified the Arsenal away strip although she didn't recall the score of the 2014 FA Cup final . Club loyalty was an important part of the exam and Saskia knew  the score when it came to Sanchez v Hazard . Saskia’s recall of last year’s FA Cup final was also tested, but she mustn’t have been paying attention that day when the Gunners beat Hull 3-2 (not 2-0) and Aaron Ramsey scored the winner (not Olivier Giroud). After correctly identifying a yellow Gunners shirt as the away strip, Saskia was asked to name the entire Arsenal starting XI with their positions for 22 points. She faltered only in calling Mesut Ozil a defender, Danny Welbeck a midfielder instead of a striker (harsh marking) and leaving out Laurent Koscielny altogether. Alexis Sanchez 'is buff,' says Saskia in one answer; although she thought Mesut Ozil was a defender . In her boyfriend’s feedback he advised Saskia to ‘Learn all player positions’ and how she is supposed to feel about North London rivals Tottenham. ‘I salute your boyfriend! And you deserve a medal for being such a sport!’ tweeted Sajan Gupta (‏@Maverick_3).",

    "article": "David Cameron has admitted he will have failed as Tory leader if he does not win a majority at the next election. The Prime Minister said voters were not ‘fully sure’ about the Tories at the last election, but claimed they would back the party this time. He said he only needed 23 seats to win a majority, before adding: ‘If I fall short of those 23 seats I will feel I have not succeeded.’ David Cameron has admitted he will have failed as Tory leader if he does not win a majority at the next election . The Prime Minister said voters were not ‘fully sure’ about the Tories at the last election, but would back them this time . Mr Cameron made the remarks in an interview with the BBC’s Evan Davis in the second of a series of special election interviews. The PM also revealed that nothing made him ‘more angry’ than the Tories being called the party of the rich and admitted there were people who did not pay tax in Britain who ‘damn well should’. Mr Cameron’s remarks came after the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted the Tories were getting rattled because they knew they could not win an outright majority next month. Polls have consistently put the Tories and Labour Party neck and neck with just three weeks to go before polling day. But Mr Cameron insisted voters would come round to the Tories in the final days of the campaign. He said: ‘At the last election when we came close I think frankly people were very worried about the state of the economy, we were teetering on the brink and they weren’t fully sure we had all the ideas and plans. ‘What I would say is this time people can see a track record. An economy turned round, more people in work, the deficit paid down, Britain on the brink of something special. ‘This time I believe they can put their trust in me and in the Conservative Party to deliver that better future for the country.’ The PM also revealed that nothing made him ‘more angry’ than the Tories being called the party of the rich and admitted there were people who did not pay tax in Britain who ‘damn well should' Mr Cameron made the remarks in an interview with the BBC’s Evan Davis in the second of a series of special election interviews . But Mr Cameron admitted he would be seen as a failure if he failed to win an outright majority on May 7. He said: ‘We are only 23 seats short and if I fall short of those 23 seats I will feel I have not succeeded in what I want to achieve.’ In the first of the series of leaders' interviews Mr Clegg said he would reject another coalition with the Conservatives if they insist on their proposed £12bn welfare cuts. The Tories have said details of this will be set out after the election, and Mr Cameron said: \"What we're proposing is totally affordable and doable.\" Despite his planned welfare cuts, Mr Cameron said the Tories were not the party of the rich. He said: 'Look there will be people watching this programme who go out, who work damn hard every day, they pay their taxes. 'They don’t pay their taxes so that people who can work choose not to. You know, the reward sometimes for irresponsible behaviour can drive people mad – can drive me mad and that’s one of the reasons to reform welfare.' He said that accusations that the Conservatives are \"the party of the rich\" make him \"more angry than almost anything else\". He said: 'What infuriates me so much about this is I think of what we’ve done. We’ve taken three million of the lowest paid people out of tax. 'It’s the people at the bottom end that I care about. That’s what this government has been about – more good schools for children from low income backgrounds getting people into work who’ve been unemployed.’",
