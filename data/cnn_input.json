    "article": "A young woman on Reddit has shared a set of inspiring before and after images, which showcase how an exercise plan she began 20 months ago in an effort to lessen her depression has not only helped her mentally – but has also ensured a dramatic physical transformation. Aliesha Peterson, 22, detailed the extensive fitness routine that helped her go from 145lbs to 127lbs – and enabled the Alberta, Canada, resident to gain a noticeably fitter, and much more muscular, physique, as well as an impressive six-pack. 'I can honestly say I am sooo thankful I started taking better care of myself [sic],' she wrote under her Reddit name ahhhgodzilla. 'My progress has been fairly slow but, to me, the most important thing is that I didn't give up.' Scroll down for video . Impressive results: Aliesha Peterson, 22, first started exercising in August 2013, left; as of April 2015, right, she has lost nearly 20lbs and gained a six-pack . Aliesha wasn't always a fan of working out - and explained that she didn't start hitting the gym to look better in a bikini, either. 'I was extremely depressed and refusing to go back on anti-depressants,' she explained. 'I went and saw a therapist, and she recommended that I join a gym and start working out three times a week. 'I reluctantly obliged and to be completely honest, I absolutely hated it. 'I hated how uncomfortable I felt there, that I obviously had no idea what I was doing.' But after three months of sticking with it, she admitted that she started to 'somewhat enjoy it'. Aliesha's routine is made up of exercises that focus on a different part of her body for each day of the week, and she will often do cardio on the weekends. Her workouts include several sets of squats, bench presses, crunches, curls, and planks. On Wednesdays, she works on her back, which she said is her favorite part of her body. Her back exercises include deadlifts, hyperextensions, and chin ups. Bringing sexy back: The 22-year-old says her back is her favorite part of her body, and she focuses on exercises to strengthen it every Wednesday . 'Before' body: Aliesha, pictured here in 2013 before she started exercising, was by no means overweight, but she has since become more toned by sticking to a demanding workout schedule . After about six months, Aliesha started changing her eating habits, too. While she once stuck to an unhealthy diet which included fast food 'at least twice a day', she began cooking her own meals and choosing to eat healthy food. Now, her diet consists of eggs, yogurt, fruit, chicken, seeds and nuts, green smoothies made with vegetables, protein shakes, turkey, and salmon. Aliesha admits that her story isn't one of shocking rapid weight loss - but she says her slow progress is the reason she's been so successful. 'I'm sure if I completely changed my lifestyle all at once that my results would have been a lot more impressive in a much shorter amount of time, but it would not have been sustainable,' she wrote. Because she's worked at a slow, steady pace, she's been able to maintain her new figure - which has been a boon to her self-esteem. 'I am much more confident in my body,' she told Daily Mail Online. 'I no longer hate looking in the mirror and have learned to accept my flaws and am able to see the positive qualities I possess as well.' Barely-there biceps: In October 2013, pictured, Aliesha had only just started going to the gym to help her improve her depression . Welcome to the gun show: Pictured this month, Aliesha's arms have grown much more muscular; she says she now loves going to the gym . Of course, Aliesha added, it isn't always easy to maintain the motivation to work out five to seven days a week, but sticking to a routine has helped. 'I truly believe the key to bettering yourself is to cultivate and preserve healthy habits,' she continued. 'The first few months are the hardest, but once you make it through that stage it becomes a lot less painful, and you may even learn to enjoy it like I have.' She is also enjoying what working out has done for her mental health. 'While I still struggle with depression, it is much, much less severe,' she said. 'Instead of laying in bed all day crying, letting it consume me, I get up and do things - go to the gym, do yoga, walk my dogs, see friends. 'The best part of getting into this routine has definitely been the mental change,' she concluded. 'My friends and family have all noticed the difference, my relationships are stronger, I feel better about myself, and I'm constantly striving for self improvement.'",

    "article": "With just over a week to go until the Duchess of Cambridge hits her due date, preparations for the new arrival at her Norfolk home, dubbed 'Fortress Anmer', have been heating up. Carole Middleton, the new arrival's grandmother, has become a permanent fixture at the country home, while in the nursery, nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo is preparing to welcome a second charge. But while much of the effort has focused on Prince George and making sure he doesn't feel left out, more still has gone in to giving the nursery a makeover. Scroll down for video . Preparation: The birth of Prince George's new brother or sister is expected to happen later this week . Overseen by Mrs Middleton, both the Anmer nursery and the one at Kensington Palace, have been given a Beatrix Potter theme. Fittings for both are thought have come from luxury children's furniture emporium, Dragons of Knightsbridge, where Moses baskets start at £75. But in a curious twist, it is understood that Kate had several pots of pink paint delivered to Anmer Hall from the Annie Sloane store a couple of weeks ago. In a move certain to invite further speculation over the sex of the baby, among colours chosen was Henrietta, which is described as a 'beautiful rich complex pink with a hint of lilac.' Another was Antoinette, a 'soft pale pink with a hint of brown' that is redolent of 'old-fashioned roses and the colour of old plaster' and the third, Emile, a 'warm soft aubergine colour with pink and red undertones'. Home: The new baby will spend its first few weeks at his or her parents' Norfolk home, Anmer Hall . London pad: The new arrival will also have the run of a second nursery at Kensington Palace . Each pot comes with a price tag fit for a royal, with just one litre of the paint costing £18.95. Kensington Palace refused to comment on the story saying that they could neither 'confirm' nor 'deny' that the couple had plans to paint the nursery. Echoing the palace's line, a spokesman for Annie Sloan said the company could not ‘confirm or deny’ that it had supplied paints to Anmer Hall. Nonetheless, a pink nursery appears more likely than the African-themed one hinted at by Prince William in an interview with CNN. 'I'll have toy elephants and rhinos around the room,' he joked. 'We'll cover it in lots of bushes and things like that, make him grow up as if he's in the bush.' Boy or girl? Kate's pink coat and pink paints have fuelled speculation over the new baby's sex . Compelling: Annie Sloan has  supplied three feminine paint samples to Anmer Hall . Whatever the nursery's eventual colour, more work still has gone in to turning Anmer Hall into a secluded property where Prince George - and his new sibling - can enjoy a relatively normal childhood. The refurbishment, which has taken two years and cost £1.5 million, has seen new security features added to the ten bedroom property which also has a swimming pool, tennis court and extensive grounds. As part of the costly renovations – which also included installing a new roof, a state-of-the-art kitchen and a conservatory – William had the driveway to the property, which used to belong to his close friends the Van Cutsem family, rerouted so that anyone accessing the property is shielded by trees. More money has been spent on filling the royal nursery and with both William and Kate known to have traditional tastes, it's safe to say that that extends to the toy box. Prince George has been cutting his teeth on old-fashioned wooden toys, while his reading material includes the Curious George books - the first of which was published in the 1950s. Toys for the new baby will be no exception and are likely to have a homespun wholesome feel much like this £34 Anne-Claire Petit Crochet Lamb Music Box. Prepared: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also have plenty of pieces left over from Prince George . Traditional: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have traditional tastes and prefer old-fashioned toys . One for George: The couple were presented with a Dorothy and Theodore box when George was born . Tally ho! Both royal children are likely to start riding as soon as they are big enough, much like the Queen . Kate, who has made no secret of her liking for traditional fittings such as Moses baskets, is also likely to follow suit when it comes to toy boxes. Indeed, the couple already own one, having been gifted a £360 Dorothy and Theodore toy box by 10 Downing Street following Prince George's birth. Another Dorothy and Theodore piece likely to feature in the royal nursery is the company's £550 rosewood rocking horse. William is a keen horseman and both Prince George and the new baby will have no shortage of steeds to choose from when they get a bit bigger. Indeed, the royal baby's great-grandmother, the Queen, has been riding since the age of four when she was presented with a Shetland pony named Peggy.",

    "article": "The runaway success of Furious 7 shows no signs of slowing down as the high-octane action movie enjoyed its third winning weekend in a row at the domestic box office. The reigning box office champion might have slowed from its blockbuster debut, but Furious 7 maintained first place for the third weekend in a row with an estimated $29.1 million, according to box office tracker Rentrak on Sunday. This brings the fast car sequel's domestic total to a staggering $294 million, well above the $202.8 million that Fast & Furious 6 had earned at the same point in the cycle in 2013. Scroll down for video . The fast car sequel, starring Vin Diesel, has raced to number seven on the list of highest grossing movies in just three weeks and is predicted to overtake the likes of Frozen and Iron Man 3 in a matter of weeks . Crashing hit: The blockbuster, also co-starring Vin Diesel and Jason Statham, has already earned $1 billion . On Friday, Furious 7 joined the $1 billion club at the worldwide box office, leaping into the top twenty grossing films of all time worldwide. Over the weekend, Furious 7 added even more to its international total, jumping even higher on the all-time worldwide charts. Furious 7 is now one of the ten highest grossing movies of all-time worldwide, ranking seventh with $1.152 billion. With Furious 7 still going strong, the question becomes now how high can it climb? The film will almost certainly race past Iron Man 3 and Frozen to join the top five all-time at the worldwide box office before the month is out. 'The film has set a new standard for the potential for box-office in the pre-summer month of April and has truly become part of movie folklore with its record setting numbers, strong reviews, spectacular word-of-mouth and of course the outpouring of support for late star Paul Walker,' Rentrak's Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian said. Poll position: Furious 7, starring the late Paul Walker, right, won the box office crown for the third week running, taking an estimated $29.1 million over the weekend . Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 came in a close second with an estimated $24 million. While the PG-rated comedy didn't perform as well as the first film's $31.8 million opening in 2009, it did surpass Sony's modest expectations. Also, it only cost $30 million to produce. 'It's a great result. It's going to be very profitable for us and a big success,' Sony's President of Worldwide Distribution Rory Bruer said. 'It was something that Kevin really wanted to do and we wanted to do it with him,' he said. 'Kudos to Kevin for working so hard in promoting the film.' Dergarabedian said 'Blart's' opening 'proves that if you give the people what they want, you can make a tidy profit.' Meanwhile, the low-budget, social media themed thriller Unfriended took third place with $16 million — sixteen times its production budget.",

    "article": "A man has made the infamous shepherds pie-trifle combination of custard, jam and meat immortalised in popular TV show Friends. On the show hapless character Rachel decided to treat her loved ones to what she mistakenly thought was 'a traditional English trifle' layered with all the trimmings - including ladyfingers, jam, custard, beef sautéed with peas and onions, a little more custard, bananas and some whipped cream. Now one brave Mancunian has whipped up their own version of the unusual concoction - replacing the beef with the far more traditional lamb. Scroll down for video . Neil Killham made the infamous shepherds pie-trifle combination immortalised on Friends 16 years ago. It features sponge, jam, custard, lamb, peas, onions, whipped cream and is garnished with sprinkles . Neil Killham, a 32-year-old software engineer from Manchester, announced his plans on Twitter with a picture of his clashing ingredients with the caption: 'It's finally time. I'm making The Trifle Out Of Friends.' Giving a running commentary on the social media site, Neil proudly showed off the finished masterpiece which actually looked very respectable - until he cut into it. He told his followers that while it does not taste like feet - as characters on the show claimed - it was still 'f****** horrible'. He added: 'But with enough nice trifle stuff that we keeping eating more of it.' The trifle-shepherds pie combination did not look quite as appetising once it had been sliced into . Friends character Rachel Green (played by Jennifer Aniston) accidentally made the disgusting dessert . Neil posted this picture of a friend attempting a second go at the trifle pie - it doesn't appear to have improved . 'I thought I'd be able to compartmentalise the clashing flavours, but I cannot.' When MailOnline asked how it tasted, Neil, who shared the dish with friends, said: 'It tasted terrible of course - but not so bad that I couldn't finish my slice. 'It's the way you sometimes think you've got lucky and got a nice pure trifle bite and then pow! Lamb!' He said in the last year he has made curry flavoured cupcakes, a chilli cheesecake and a pancake pizza, among other things. 'Usually they kind of work, so I figured it was time to try something that definitely wouldn't,' he said. 'Although when I tried sprouts in marmite that didn't work either, but it wasn't as bad as this. 'A couple of people tried it with me last night and agreed it was terrible. Opinions were mixed on whether the lamb or the onion was the biggest problem. 'Then a couple of people at work also tried it and came to similar conclusions. 'Except for one guy who said \"it wasn't that bad really. Not good, but not the worst\". 'I'm not sure I can trust him any more.' The trifle looked distinctly unappetising when dished up on a plate - and apparently tasted even worse . In the show the dessert was described as half trifle, half shepherd's pie after two pages in the English cookery book Rachel was using stuck together - but the creators mistakenly used beef instead of the lamb which is traditional in the pie. Towards the end of the season six episode the penny finally drops and Rachel says: 'I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!' If for some reason you would like to recreate this Heston Blumenthal-esque clash of flavours and textures, the recipe would appear to be: A layer of sponge, layer of jam, layer of custard, layer of raspberries, another layer of sponge, layer of lamb sautéed with peas and onions, a bit more custard, banana, and a topping of whipped cream garnished with hundreds and thousands .",

    "article": "President Barack Obama invited the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots to the White House on Thursday - but couldn't help but get one last deflategate joke in. The president opened his speech on the South Lawn by remarking 'that whole (deflategate) story got blown out of proportion,' referring to an investigation that 11 out of 12 footballs used in the AFC Championship game were under-inflated. But then came the zinger: 'I usually tell a bunch of jokes at these events, but with the Patriots in town I was worried that 11 out of 12 of them would fall flat.' Scroll down for video . Boo! Hiss! President Barack Obama elicited groans and a thumbs down from head coach Bill Belichick after cracking a deflategate joke while honoring the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots . Obama also quipped that he wished Chicago could learn something from Boston's championship-winning ways . Disapproval rating: Head coach Bill Belichick gives the thumbs down after Obama cracked a de-flate gate joke that left the whole team groaning . Obama received a custom jersey and a custom football from the team at the White House on Thursday . The Patriots assembled behind him groaned. Coach Bill Belichick, who is notoriously humorless, responded by giving the president a thumbs down. Obama was flanked by Belichick and billionaire Patriots owner Bob Kraft. Missing from the occasion, though was the Super Bowl MVP and the team's biggest star - Tom Brady. A spokesman for the team cited 'prior family commitments' as the reason Brady, 37, didn't attend the ceremony. Sports commentators, including retired football great Boomer Esiason, speculated that Brady snubbed Obama because he's from the 'wrong political party.' The superstar athlete has been to the White House before. He does have three other Super Bowl rings, afterall. But all the prior championships were under the Bush Administration. February's win was the first for the Patriots since Obama took office. Brady has also met Obama at least once before, as well. He was pictured with the then-US Senator  at the 2005 White House Correspondents dinner.

Brady won his fourth Super Bowl ring in February - and his first since President Obama took office . Tom Brady met President Barack Obama at least once. He is pictured here with the then-US Senator and rival quarterback Donovan McNabb in 2005 . It's not clear what Brady's prior commitment was. His supermodel wife Gisele Bündchen, usually active on social media, gives no hint where the family is today if not in Washington. Brady led the Patriots to his fourth Super Bowl victory in February after defeating the Seattle Seahawks 28-24. Despite his arm and movement being somewhat diminished by age, Brady's leadership and calm under pressure also won him Super Bowl MVP - his third. Whatever is taking up Brady's time this week, he made time next week to be ringside at the Floyd Mayweather Jr.-Manny Pacquiao fight in Las Vegas next weekend. According to Sport Illustrated, Brady appealed directly to CBS president Les Moonves for tickets to the much-touted matchup.

    "article": "(CNN)He was known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that's devoted blood and resources to attacking it. But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \"likely a separate\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \"providing aid and comfort\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists.\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\" he said. \"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.",

The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.' Graeme Dott plays a shot during his match against Ricky Walden during the Betfred World Championships .",

Tim Sherwood's Villa side won the coin toss ahead of the final next month - which allows the winner to select club colours in the event of a clash of strip. They picked their claret and blue home kit for the Wembley showpiece and therefore guaranteed that they will have worn the same strip for every round of the competition this season. Alexis Sanchez (far right) is congratulated  after scoring Arsenal's semi-final winner against Reading . Arsenal players celebrate winning the 1979 FA Cup final at Wembley after beating Manchester United 3-2 . The Arsenal starting XI line up ahead of their FA Cup final against Liverpool on May 8, 1971 . But that won't phase Arsene Wenger's side at all, with a creditable record of three cup final wins in five appearances in the yellow and blue strip, giving Gunners fans room for optimism as they look to retain the FA Cup. Arsenal last wore yellow in the 1980 FA Cup final where they narrowly lost to London rivals West Ham United, but a year earlier donned the same colours as they got the better of Manchester United in a five-goal thriller at the home of English football. The Gunners also won the competition in 1950 and 1971 while wearing yellow, on both occasions seeing off Liverpool.

The kick-off time for the clash - which will be shown on both BBC One and BT Sport 1 - has also been confirmed as 5.30pm on Saturday May 30, with both clubs receiving an equal allocation of 25,000 tickets. These tickets will be classified into four different pricing bands - £50, £70, £90 and £120. In addition to the 50,000 tickets split between the two clubs involved, approximately 20,000 tickets also will be distributed to volunteers throughout the football family which most notably includes counties, leagues, local clubs and charities.

Liverpool’s captain provided the 70th-minute assist for Coutinho to break Blackburn Rovers’ resistance and secure a 1-0 win that sets up a Wembley date against Aston Villa a week on Sunday. It has been a dramatic 24 hours for Henderson, as his partner Beccy gave birth to their second daughter, Alba. The 25-year-old had not slept the night before the game. Philippe Coutinho hit the only goal of the game as Liverpool advanced to the FA Cup semi-finals . Kolo Toure (left) embraces new father Jordan Henderson on a day to remember for the Liverpool captain . The Brazilian playmaker put in a real all-action display for his team. As well as scoring the winner, he had the most shots, most touches, the highest duel success, highest dribble completion, and the most tackles. Henderson said: ‘Philippe has a great football brain. It’s the easy bit giving it to him. Another bit of brilliance wins the game and gives everyone a lift.’ Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers revealed Henderson told him there was no chance he was missing the fixture once the baby had arrived. Rodgers explained: 'His wife had a second child during the night so he had to go away, hadn't slept so much, travelled all the way back again and put in the performance he did tonight. It was a real captain's performance. 'He said to me, \"Boss, as soon as the baby's out, I'll be coming back\".' Brendan Rodgers (right) looks on as his side navigated their way through a tricky tie at Ewood Park . Liverpool celebrate a much-needed victory which sets up a Wembley date with Aston Villa on Sunday week . Coutinho has popped up with some important goals this season — five of his six strikes have earned Liverpool results (four wins and a draw). Rodgers thought the much-publicised review meeting he held with Liverpool's players on Sunday paved the way for them to get back to winning ways in the FA Cup. The Reds boss had denied a report that an internal meeting following the 4-1 defeat to Arsenal had descended into crisis talks and his players responded on the pitch by booking their spot in the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley with a hard-fought 1-0 replay victory over Blackburn. 'There was a lot made of that,' he said. 'I'm a coach who speaks openly to players. Part of the coaching philosophy for me is about reviewing and reflecting performance. 'It's something that we've done all year when we were winning games. That provides us the lever to move forward - how can we be better, how can we improve? 'Because we lost a couple of games, there's a lot been made of that meeting but that review was very, very important in how we want to work. If you don't review and analyse your performance how can you get better?'",

    "article": "A young mother has spoken of her humiliation after a dental assistant apparently removed her nine-month-old son from her arms without asking while she was breastfeeding him in the dentist's chair. Tayler Chaice Buzbee was forced to make an emergency appointment at an Aspen Dental facility in Alabama on Friday morning after developing agonizing toothache which would not go away. But after calling the dentist's office, she was informed that the only available appointment was in just 20 minutes - meaning that she had no time to find a babysitter for her infant son, Attley. Instead, Tayler was assured by employees that she could bring her baby to the facility. The pair turned up shortly after - but midway through the appointment, Attley started to create a fuss. Upset: Tayler Chaice Buzbee has spoken of her humiliation after a dental assistant apparently removed her baby son, Attley (pictured with Tayler) from her arms while she was breastfeeding him in the dentist's chair . 'I don't nurse in public, and I never have because I hear these stories about people being shamed... I don't do well with being confronted, so I usually find another room to go to,' Tayler toldAL.com. But she said that, in this instance, she had no option but to breastfeed Attley - a gorgeous dark-haired baby with big brown eyes and a cheeky grin - because he was hungry and causing a scene. The hygienists apparently did not mind Tayler nursing her son - and one even offered to halt the treatment and return when she was finished. But Tayler declined and continued to be treated. A short while later, the dentist and another female employee came into the room. The latter reportedly told Tayler that she was not permitted to breastfeed her baby in the dentist's office. Then, while the dentist examined Tayler's teeth, the employee removed Attley from her arms - without permission and before he had finished feeding from his mom - because he was 'in the way'. She then placed him in a stroller, it is reported. Tayler, who was shocked, left the office soon after. Controversy: While the dentist examined Tayler's teeth, a female employee removed Attley from her arms - without permission and before he had finished feeding from his mom - because he was 'in the way' Facility: Tayler had made the emergency appointment at the Aspen Dental facility (file picture) in Alabama on Friday after developing agonizing toothache. She was left 'humiliated' after the breastfeeding incident . Speaking to the news site, the Marshalls employee said: 'I have never felt so humiliated in my life.' She added: 'That was my biggest concern. Don't take him out of my arms. It was a situation where I was humiliated, I was crying, and I felt just embarrassed to be there.' In a statement, Aspen Dental Management Inc apologized to Tayler. 'No nursing mother should ever be made to feel uncomfortable while feeding her child,' representative Kasey Pickett told AL.com. She added that the company is investigating the incident. It is not the first time a new mother has been 'shamed' for breastfeeding in public. Mother and son: Despite the female employee's actions, the dental hygienists apparently did not mind Tayler (back) nursing her son (front) - and one even offered to halt the treatment and return when she was finished . 'Shamed': It is not the first time a new mother like Tayler (pictured, left, with Attley) has been 'shamed' for breasfeeding in public. In January, 24-year-old mother Alanna Panas claimed she was kicked out of a casino in Berlin, Maryland, for breastfeeding her seven-week-old daughter (right, with Alanna) in the lobby . In January, 24-year-old mother Alanna Panas claimed she was kicked out of a casino in Berlin, Maryland, for breastfeeding her seven-week-old daughter in the lobby. Alanna, a mother-of-one from Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, said she was thrown out by security at the Casino at Ocean Down after they told her she and daughter Lilly were a 'security risk'. She said she had intended to feed her daughter in her car but did not have time to get the keys and as it was a cold, rainy evening, the casino lobby was her only choice,USA Today reported. Last year, an international study found mothers are made to feel 'ashamed' when they breastfeed in public - while many are put off breastfeeding by negative comments from health workers. Mothers reported being stared at or tutted at and felt as if they were seen as 'hippies' or 'weirdos'. Others said they wanted to breastfeed after 12 months but feared public disapproval. Negative emotions are also common for new mothers who are trying to breastfeed in hospital soon after giving birth. These are due to staff actions and comments, the research found. Dr Gill Thomson, of the Maternal and Infant Nutrition and Nurture Unit at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, led the study, which also involved researchers in Germany and Sweden.",

Heartbroken owner Tony Tancock believes only an expert could have targetted the dozen show-quality guinea pigs stolen leaving more ordinary rodents behind. Tony, 56, has won accolades for his specially-bred cavies and has shown them off at events around the country. But he was devastated after a thief snuck into an outbuilding at his home in Crediton, Devon, to steal his prized pets leaving eight behind. Robbed: Police investigating the theft of 12 prize-winning guinea pigs from top breeder Tony Tancock (pictured) have not ruled out - a rival competitor . Sabotage: Heartbroken owner Tancock (pictured) believes only an expert could have targetted the dozen show-quality guinea pigs . He said: 'They knew exactly what they were looking for. They took two tortoiseshells, two black and two brown, all short-haired guinea pigs that besides being show-quality, were also beloved family pets. 'They left six which were not show quality, plus two other show ones.' Tony yesterday issued a desperate plea to the thief to return the treasured pets to him. He said: 'Please bring them back. I miss them dearly and am really worried about them. I would like to know they didn't just get bumped off. They were priceless to me.' Guinea pig fancying took off in the 1890s but a fascination for the furry animals began when they were introduced to Britain from South America in the 1500s. They are still bred for their meat in several countries on the South American continent and are a particular delicacy in the Andes. The biggest event in a guinea pig fanciers calendar - the Bradford Championship Show - draws hundreds of participating critters, competing in categories separated according to breeds. But Tony said that unless his guinea pigs are returned he will not be able to appear at any shows this year. A cavy expert has warned the thefts could be a hate crime from someone with a score to settle. But Bryan Mayoh, chairman of the British Cavy Council, expressed shock at the suggestion a fellow competitor could have deliberately targeted Tony. Heart-broken: Mr Tancock was devastated after a thief snuck into an outbuilding at his home in Crediton, Devon, to steal his prized pets leaving eight behind . He said: 'I would suggest that a personal dispute is a far more likely explanation than that some person was envious of his cavies. 'Real fanciers know how important cavies are to other fanciers and would not dream of trying to steal animals from them. 'In addition, it is very likely that someone attempting to remove cavies at a show would be noticed by other fanciers. 'In 25 years of showing I never had a cavy stolen, nor have any of my fancier friends.' 'But my advice would be to be vigilant of anyone behaving suspiciously at a show and ensure that garden sheds in which cavies are kept at home are padlocked when the owner is absent.' Police say they are investigating the thefts and asked anyone with information to contact them on 101.",

    "article": "It is eight long, barren years since an English club claimed the top prize in European rugby and the bookmakers aren't convinced the grim cycle can be broken this year. When Wasps claimed the Heineken Cup in 2007 with victory over Leicester, it seemed unthinkable that the Premiership would not produce another continental champion for so long. Yet since then Irish teams have seized four titles — Leinster claiming a hat-trick — and French teams three, accurately reflecting the balance of power in the European game. This season is not seen as any real exception, despite the presence of four English sides in the last eight of the new Champions Cup. There is a consensus among the bookies that holders Toulon are destined to finish on top of the pile for the third successive year, with Clermont their primary challengers followed by Racing and Leinster. The Aviva Premiership quartet are all away from home this weekend and are all firm underdogs. Francois Louw runs with the ball during the Bath Rugby training session held at Farleigh House . Bath's George Ford practices his kicking during the training session at the Farleigh House complex . Leinster's Jamie Heaslip is tackled by Sailosi Tagicakibau during the Champions Cup match with Wasps . In World Cup year it would provide a clear boost to national morale if one of their elite clubs could shatter the status quo by lifting the trophy on May 2 but there are significant reasons why an English triumph shouldn't happen. The first comes down to money. Northampton, Saracens, Bath and Wasps are well-funded, with strong squads, but their resources are modest compared to French powerhouses Toulon, Clermont and Racing, who have budgets three or four times the size of their Premiership opponents. Across the Channel, squads are awash with Test-class players from around the world, even on the bench. Meanwhile, Leinster have superb recent European pedigree and benefit from the Irish system which sees top players rested from league duties in order to peak on these major occasions.Bath will find themselves in hostile territory at the Aviva Stadium, but they went to Toulouse in January and scorched the earth to win 35-18. If their pack can go toe-to-toe with the hosts, the likes of Jonathan Joseph are capable of wreaking havoc. Make no mistake, Mike Ford's team are capable of winning in Dublin. Also on Saturday, Northampton face an arduous task in trying to storm the Stade Marcel Michelin fortress where Clermont are on a 22-match unbeaten run in Europe. The Saints are the only English team to win an away quarter-final against French opposition — beating Biarritz 7-6 in 2007. English sides have lost the eight other quarter-finals they have played across the Channel. Clermont's New Zealand winger Zac Guildford (left) tries to escape a tackle during the match against Paris . Clermont winger Napolioni Nalaga (right) charges with the ball during the match against Bordeaux-Begles . Nothampton's Stephen Myler (left) and Luther Burrell (right) prepare to tackle Jamie Roberts of Racing Metro . The current Premiership champions were losing Heineken Cup finalists in 2011. To reach that stage again would require a monumental result this weekend, but Clermont are far from infallible, as Saracens proved, thrashing them 46-6 in last season's epic semi-final. The London club lost to Toulon in the final, but they have been the standard-bearers for English rugby in the last two seasons and will believe they can go to Paris and beat Racing, who can be wildly inconsistent. Wasps captain James Haskell provides a link back to the club's distant 2007 success, but Dai Young's men will be confronting a multi-national force in Toulon that would beat most Test teams. If they were to stun the holders, it would go down as one of the greatest shocks in European competition. There is a fair chance that one English team can progress, with Bath and Saracens the more likely candidates. If two were to make it, that would provide a colossal and timely boost to national morale. Wasps captain James Haskell receives a pass during the training session at Twyford Avenue Sports Ground .",

    "article": "A formerly obese man has revealed how he finally became motivated to lose 160lbs from his 354lbs frame over the course of 20 months, after nearly a lifetime of emotional eating and self-loathing. Atlanta-based writer Alex Gray, 27, admitted that he once made excuses for his gluttonous habits, which included trips to drive-through restaurants up to four times a day, but it wasn't until an obese friend 'unveiled a shockingly svelte silhouette' that he was inspired to make changes in his own life . 'There are a lot of platitudes about weight,' he wrote in an essay for Salon. 'One of them is that you should love yourself no matter your size. I’m here to say that’s bullsh**. Being fat sucks. I love myself way more now than I ever have. Scroll down for video . Inner turmoil: Alex aid that he had 'missed out on a lot' when he was clocking in at 354lbs (pictured) New man: The writer was pictured at a Miami Dolphins football game after he lost nearly half of his body weight in 20 months . Alex explained that there are people who are unable to lose weight because of genetics or other factors - but he was not one of them. 'For those who can do something about their size, and simply refuse to, trust me: Life is so much better on the other side,' he explained. Alex said that he couldn't think of a 'specific catalyst' that prompted him to gain weight, but he recalled that he had an insatiable appetite 'as an only child with unabated access to nearly everything'. As he got older, he grew bigger, and by the time he was in college, he found himself struggling with physical intimacy because of his size. Alex recalled one woman who called him out for breathing heavily during one of their sexual encounters. He confessed that the panting was because he was winded - not because he was caught up in the heat of the moment. But the worse he felt about himself, the more he ate. 'I’ve never tried drugs, but I empathize with those addicted to the needle, or the pipe,' he wrote. 'I know what it feels like to be acutely aware your vice is killing you, or at the very least, keeping you from living your best life. Alex explained attempted to lose weight a few times, but neither the promise of an extended football career or a new car could motivate him to stick with it because he was unable to 'escape food's gravitational pull'. It wasn't until he saw his friend Joubert, who once had a similar frame to his, show off his fit new body at a Cinco De Mayo reunion that he became motivated to start making changes in his own life. Days later, Alex went walking, and eventually his walks turned into runs. He made dietary changes too, including swapping burgers for lean rotisserie chicken. It took a little less than two years to reach his 'physical ideal', and Alex explained that his whole world has changed. His only regret is not doing it sooner. Alex noted that not only is he now comfortable with the opposite sex, but for the first time in his life, he is the one who is being pursued. He is thrilled that he can finally buy clothes off the rack at stores such as H&M, adding that he finally feels like he physically fits in. Alex ended his story by saying that he finally started his life at 25-years-old, and to remind others struggling with their weight, that if he can do it, they can do it too.",

    "article": "An honest taxi driver has made a friend for life after returning a bag a passenger left on the back seat of his car - containing £10,000 in cash. Mohammed Nisar, 55, had been driving sole trader Adrian Quinn to Walsall train station when the passenger hopped out of the vehicle in a rush, forgetting his rucksack. He had been carrying the hefty sum of money after cashing a cheque from his inheritance following the death of his mother - and on realising his mistake says he felt 'dazed'. Reward: Taxi driver Mohammed Nisar (left) accepts a reward from sole trader Adrian Quinn after returning a bag the passenger left in his taxi containing £10,000 in cash . Mr Quinn, 46, of Hereford, said: 'Losing that money would have been the end of my business. I was physically sick! He realised he had left the bag in the car just seconds after Mr Nisar dropped him at the station. He added: 'I was walking across the car park when I realised I hadn't got my bag and I panicked. I tried to flag down another taxi but they all had fares. 'I was sick. My body just went into shut-down and I didn't know what to do.. I was just in a daze. If I'd lost that bag it would have been the end of my business. 'We have built it up from nothing for the last nine years and we are sole traders. We don't have the backing of banks. It is hard work, but it earns us a living.' After eventually flagging down another cab the father-of-three arrived back at the taxi rank in a flustered state to find Mr Nisar sitting in his car with the bag safely on the passenger seat. Honest cabbie: Mr Nisar believes 'honesty is the best policy' and has returned a number of valuable lost items to passengers in the past . He said: 'I was very emotional. I said, \"Do you know what was in that bag? Put it this way, it is not a box of sandwiches or a newspaper. There is £10,000 in there\".' Mr Quinn gave Mohammed a cash reward to thank him - in an envelope marked 'to my best friend in the world' - and has even invited him and his wife to his home for a family meal. Mr Nisar, 55, said: 'He nearly had a heart attack, he was really worried! 'He came up to me and asked if I realised what was in the bag. He was very, very thankful. He had just bought a car but forgot the bag full of money.' It is not the first time Mr Nisar, who has been a self-employed taxi driver for 15 years, has found things in the back of his car. Only two years ago one passenger left a wallet containing £150 in, but Mohammed drove straight back to the man's home to return it. New friend: Mr Quinn hands a cash reward to Mr Nisar in an envelope labelled 'to my best friend in the world' Now, following his latest find, he is urging fellow taxi drivers to do the same if they find themselves in the same situation. Mohammed said: 'At the end of the day honesty is the best policy. There are some drivers who don't return things but what is the point? 'If the council had not have called me and no-one had have claimed it after 12 or 24 hours I would have taken that bag straight to the police station. 'Mobile phones are the most common thing left behind but most of them now can be traced anyway. 'My message is to encourage all my taxi driving brothers that if they find something valuable just give it back.'",

Doerr's novel had received rave reviews upon its release last spring. \"I must blame Anthony Doerr for lost sleep, because once I started reading his new novel, 'All the Light We Cannot See,' there was no putting it down,\" wrote William T.

An earlier Guirgis work, \"The Motherf***** with the Hat,\" ran on Broadway in 2011. Elizabeth Kolbert's \"The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History\" won the Pulitzer for general nonfiction. Kolbert, a New Yorker staff writer, tackles the idea that we're at the beginning of another mass die-off. \"As the planet warms up, and carbon dioxide acidifies the oceans, all bets are off -- except the ones hinging on mass extinctions,\" wrote Nicholas Lazard in The Guardian. Despite that prospect, he added, \"Kolbert's book is not, thankfully, as depressing as you might think.

    "article": "(CNN)We want our killers to be kind. To walk into court and show remorse, tell us that they are really nice people who only did it because they feared for their lives, or they were temporarily insane. Even though those things may not be true, too often they are accepted as legitimate excuses for murder. Well, Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots tight end and now convicted murderer, made none of those excuses. He walked into court with an air of bravado, his head held high like the $40 million, NFL superstar he was just a couple of years ago. Several times he was even caught winking at his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, during the trial. And we didn't like his swagger. Hernandez didn't offer a plausible alibi. He didn't look ashamed or remorseful. He never wept. His own attorney, James Sultan, admitted that Hernandez \"witnessed\" the killing of Odin Lloyd, \"committed by somebody he knew,\" but said his client did not commit the crime. Even before the guilty verdict came down Wednesday, for many -- at least those covering the trial -- audacity seemed to be the defendant's biggest crime. \"The Arrogance of Aaron Hernandez,\" a New Yorker headline accused. I don't get it. What does it matter that Hernandez was arrogant in court, or walked with too much swagger, or even smiled at his girl? Like it or not, that is who he is. The evidence is what matters. And for once, this time it appears the jury carefully considered the damning mountain of circumstantial evidence against this defendant and came to the right decision: guilty of first-degree murder in the 2013 slaying of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez, 25, was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. He was also found guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition. It was the right decision. Still, it's hard not to feel sadness over such a senseless waste of life for both Lloyd and now Hernandez, who were once friends. Football was the best thing Hernandez ever had, especially after he father died suddenly after a routine hernia surgery in 2006. Hernandez was 16. After that his life got complicated. At 17, Hernandez went off to the University of Florida and seemed headed for greatness. There he won the John Mackey Award as the nation's best tight end and led the team in receiving during its 2009 Bowl Championship Series win. But off the field, his life was to beginning to unravel. Trouble started: bar fights, reports of marijuana use and failed drug tests. He was even questioned in relation to a shooting after a fight at a Gainesville, Florida, nightclub. By the time he was drafted in 2010 by the New England Patriots, Hernandez had already been labeled a \"troubled player.\" But neither the Patriots nor the NFL has anything to be ashamed of in how they handled the Hernandez case. They did everything right this time. Hours after Hernandez was charged with murder, he was let go from the team. And his coaches didn't spend any time trying to convince the public that their star tight end was a decent, family-loving guy, as the league has done too many times in the past when its players got in trouble. This time justice worked. There's no reason to second-guess what went wrong, to ask \"How could a star NFLer be a murderer?\" The NFL for the most part does a great job vetting its players, and certainly Hernandez is an anomaly in the league, where despite the ugly headlines, the overwhelming majority of players are upstanding, law-abiding citizens. And Patriots bashers (me included) would be mistaken to try to find fault with the team for drafting Hernandez despite his troubled past. No one really knows what evil lurks in the hearts of others, even those closest to us. Not the mothers whose sons go off and commit schoolyard killing sprees, or wives whose husbands gun down innocent people, and certainly not employers who are mostly concerned about performance on the job. There was no way to predict Hernandez would end up a murderer. He was a guy who had all the talent and opportunity in the world, but he still went wrong. Hernandez himself may have explained it best as he was being taken out of the courtroom: . According to a law enforcement source close to the case, Hernandez told officers escorting him, \"'Hey man, I'm going to miss you guys. ... I don't need any luck any more.' He gave you the impression, 'It's kinda like no big deal. ... It is what it is.' \"",
