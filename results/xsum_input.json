    "article": "\"There's a lot going on right now,\"  the singer tells us. And she's not wrong.\nThe follow-up to her Mercury Prize-nominated debut, 2013's Sing To The Moon, is imminent. Second album The Dreaming Room is due in June and her newest track Phenomenal Woman has just debuted as Annie Mac's hottest record on BBC Radio 1.\n\"And then we have probably the most important live moment on TV in this country today,\" she adds.\n\"It's all potentially extremely exciting - and that just means that I'm naturally terrified.\"\nThe singer's struggles with stage fright and anxiety are well-documented and live TV is a particular fear.\nDescribing the concept as \"just hellish\", she tells us: \"I'd rather die. That's how I feel sometimes - I think, 'if I dropped dead I wouldn't have to do it!'.\"\nSo, it's perhaps surprising that the singer let us tag along as she kicked off the new series of Later... with Jools Holland. But it seems BBC Two's esteemed music show has a special place in her heart.\n\"In the musician's world, you say 'Jools Holland' and all of a sudden you've got massive respect - it's like saying you got Glastonbury.\"\nHer third time on Later... she calls respected musician and presenter Holland a \"genuine champion\".\n\"He called me this afternoon just to say that he'd been listening to my new record and he wanted to tell me specifically what song and what parts and why.\n\"I tell you, in the TV world, it's not the kind of place where there's room for those kind of genuine interactions, just because there's so much pressure on everyone. It's very special.\"\nHere the diary of Laura's day.\nTour manager Paul picks us up in sunny east London. Laura's assistant Mariama is laden with popcorn and snacks as we pile into the silver Mercedes van bound for the studios in Kent. The singer takes some me-time behind her shades, safe in the knowledge it's going to be a long day.\n\"I'm such a weird person to be around before anything big,\" she admits.\n\"I can't normally talk, so my team tend to just leave me to it, but I'll pick up.\n\"Right now I want to be jumping up, but you don't want to celebrate before the main event, so I'm just trying to be as relaxed as I can.\"\nWe arrive to the sounds of Kano and his brass section sound-checking. He's on the bill along with Paul Simon, The Coral, Jason Isbell and Lake Street Dive.\nLaura has the honour of opening and closing both the live and pre-recorded shows, something she says she's \"glad you only find out on the day\".\n\"I'm doing Phenomenal Woman, Kiss My Feet - which the Jools team requested - and Overcome, the first single, which featured Nile Rogers.\n\"I wanted to explode back onto the scene with something that was captivating in a much rawer and darker way. That's why there's dance and so much movement this time around, and why it's such a visual album.\"\nBackstage the band are split across two dressing rooms - one for the boys and one for the girls, where we're quickly made welcome as they debate which of the many black items of clothing they've brought will get worn.\n\"There's nine of us - it's huge by pop terms, but I refused to compromise,\" says Laura.\n\"With Sing To The Moon, six of us were trying to sound like an orchestra and a choir. It was a stress.\n\"My sister Dionne went from violin to guitar - literally learnt the guitar [and] is killing it - my brother's playing cello. It feels much more like a band than me trying to do the solo artist thing. We feel like a really solid family.\"\nStill in her fur-lined boots and denim dress from the journey, Laura and the band head to the camera rehearsal. Jools arrives and gives Laura a hug, waving hello to the production team. Giant white cue cards are being written to help him introduce the acts.\nRunning through each of their tracks twice, Laura sports her new keytar in place of her trademark piano.\n\"Lady Mariama was up until 4am trying to make my keytar white. I mean what the hell is that about?\" she laughs.\n\"Initially it was a joke idea, I was just messing about jamming with it, but it made so much sense. I'm not stuck behind anything in a static way anymore, I can move and I can see people. If I want to turn and feel the band I can do that. We have such a good time now.\"\nTime for some nourishment. The team (\"there's like millions of them... making it work\") are handed pocket money for the canteen, while Laura retreats to her dressing room. As well as make-up, wardrobe and calming those nerves, she also has a TV interview to fit in.\n\"I used to not eat, I couldn't eat. But I've learned to, so you don't drop off after one song. I have meatballs and sweet potato fries. And a balance of water and red wine.\"\n\"[Designer] Alex Noble has done a lot of my clothes recently,\" says Laura. \"He is just on another planet. He text me yesterday and I was just weeping emojis because the clothes are just... I mean you'll see with the outfit tonight.\n\"I made a visual essay for the album, this massive book [filled with] images, as stimulus for new music but also to help anybody I might be collaborating with. Stylists or people in the label, anyone could take the book and go 'oh yeah, I'm listening and I'm looking'.\n\"It means I get to talk less. That's probably surprising to some people because I do love to natter! But it helps.\"\nMinutes before show time, Laura's designer and assistant are still huddled together in one of the dressing rooms with a needle and thread and the singer's fabulous outfit in their hands.\nShe's set to do an interview at Jools's famous piano, but the purple corset she'll be wearing (with matching super-flared trousers) will be too tight to sit down in. Cue furious unpicking and re-stitching. Eventually it's decided she'll do the interview standing up. Problem solved.\nWith the audience in place and schooled on how to cheer and clap in the correct manner, Laura's up first - opening the pre-recorded show with Maya Angelou-inspired anthem Phenomenal Woman.\n\"If you're first out of the blocks - you're the thing in the room that makes the first sound. I've been second and third before and everybody breathes when the sound's been made,\" says Laura.\nThere's mild panic when the lighting desk freezes after The Coral perform, but after a few minutes of confusion they're rolling again.\nLater, a respectful hush descends as Paul Simon performs Sounds Of Silence in the centre of the studio.\n\"He made me cry so much,\" says Laura. \"I kept thinking, 'why didn't I bring Mum to this gig?'. She was raised on Simon and Garfunkel.\n\"I ended up thinking about my whole life, my creative life... what is this all about? Here I am literally stood in front of Mr Paul Simon.\"\nWith all the stars limbered up (and the shortest of toilet breaks), the second show goes live on BBC Two.\n\"It's an amazing feeling because you know that it's happening now and everybody's tuned in, but at the same time - the fear and the dread. You can't correct anything, so whatever comes out is it. \"\nLaura ends the live show on a high with Phenomenal Woman.\n\"That for me was surprisingly wonderful, because live television literally - there's nothing that I'm more terrified of! And the live performance was better than the pre-record - what?!\"\nIt's all over. The audience files out and the set's dismantled as artists and their teams pack up their gear and rush to congratulate each other.\nUS outfit Lake Street Dive collar Laura for a picture, while she and sister Dionne seek out Kano for a snap (\"Because he's fine. And obviously amazing\").\n\"I always forget how emotionally exhausting it is,\" says Laura.\n\"The amount I invest into any performance is always bucket loads of sweat or tension that doesn't get released until I'm in that moment.\n\"That's the uniqueness of a show like Jools's - you are getting that concentrated performance.\"\nSo what now?\n\"Everybody laughs at me because I literally make a beeline for my bed after. I'll probably eat again later because I always get a major appetite, which is why I have this thing [grabs belly area] that will never go away.\n\"But yeah, I just conk out. If I think about stuff I'll go nuts, because you've just put something out.\n\"I mean I haven't had a child, but I imagine - like when you have a baby - it's out there. I can't push it back in!\"\nYou can catch the extended edition of Later... with Jools Holland on BBC Two on Friday 22 April at 23:15 BST or watch Tuesday night's live episode on the iPlayer now.",

    "article": "Lord Carey writes in the Daily Mail that he has dropped his opposition to the Assisted Dying Bill \"in the face of the reality of needless suffering\".\nBut the current Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has called the bill \"mistaken and dangerous\".\nPeers will debate the bill on Friday.\nTabled by Labour peer Lord Falconer, the legislation would make it legal for adults in England and Wales to be given assistance ending their own life. It would apply to those with less than six months to live.\nTwo doctors would have to independently confirm the patient was terminally ill and had reached their own, informed decision to die.\nSome 110 peers are already listed to speak when the House of Lords debates the private members bill on Friday.\nInsisting it would not be \"anti-Christian\" to change the law, Lord Carey said the current situation risked \"undermining the principle of human concern which should lie at the heart of our society\".\nHe added: \"Today we face a central paradox. In strictly observing the sanctity of life, the Church could now actually be promoting anguish and pain, the very opposite of a Christian message of hope.\"\nWhen Lord Carey was still the Archbishop of Canterbury he was among the opponents of Lord Joffe's Assisting Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill, which was successfully blocked in the House of Lords in 2006.\nBut in his article in Saturday's Daily Mail Lord Carey said: \"The fact is that I have changed my mind. The old philosophical certainties have collapsed in the face of the reality of needless suffering.\"\nHe said it was the case of Tony Nicklinson, who had locked-in syndrome and died after being refused the legal right to die , who had had the \"deepest influence\" on his decision.\nMr Nicklinson's widow Jane, said Lord Carey's switch was \"huge\".\n\"I'm amazed actually and thrilled because the Church has always been one of our greatest opponents,\" she told BBC Radio 5 live.\n\"Someone shouldn't be forced to stay alive with daily suffering - his life was a living hell.\"\nThere's been something of a shocked reaction to what Lord Carey said. Let's remember he's a former archbishop. He still has some influence in the Church, especially among the more traditionalist minded Anglicans.\nSo what he said really will have some consequences. He'll also have some influence presumably in the House of Lords, having argued in the past strongly against similar legislation.\nOne of the most telling things about what Lord Carey has said is that he now thinks it's not \"un-Christian\" to allow people to take their own lives when they're suffering at the end of their lives.\nIt speaks to a body of people, including in the Anglican church, who now feel they can to some extent re-interpret what it is to be Christian, to be Anglican and how to put that into practice in their everyday lives.\nTo hear that coming from a stalwart defender of biblical truth like Lord Carey is pretty significant.\nLord Falconer told BBC Radio 5 live that Lord Carey \"makes the point that it's not anti-Christian to support the change in the law that my bill proposes\".\n\"I believe it reflects the view of almost everyone in the debate that - whatever view you take about the issues - nobody wants people who are properly motivated by compassion to be prosecuted. And he puts those arguments incredibly powerfully.\"\nHowever, the current Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby warned Lord Falconer's bill would mean elderly and disabled people coming under pressure to end their lives.\n\"What sort of society would we be creating if we were to allow this sword of Damocles to hang over the head of every vulnerable, terminally-ill person in the country?\" he wrote in the Times.\n\"It would be very naive to think that many of the elderly people who are abused and neglected each year, as well as many severely disabled individuals, would not be put under pressure to end their lives if assisted suicide were permitted by law.\n\"It would be equally naive to believe, as the Assisted Dying Bill suggests, that such pressure could be recognised in every instance by doctors given the task of assessing requests for assisted suicide.\n\"Abuse, coercion and intimidation can be slow instruments in the hands of the unscrupulous, creating pressure on vulnerable people who are encouraged to 'do the decent thing'.\"\nThe 1961 Suicide Act makes it an offence to encourage or assist a suicide or a suicide attempt in England and Wales. Anyone doing so could face up to 14 years in prison.\nThe law is almost identical in Northern Ireland. There is no specific law on assisted suicide in Scotland, creating some uncertainty, although in theory someone could be prosecuted under homicide legislation.\nThere have already been several attempts to legalise assisted dying, but these have been rejected.\nThe Commission on Assisted Dying, established and funded by campaigners who have been calling for a change in the law, concluded in 2012 that there was a \"strong case\" for allowing assisted suicide for people who are terminally ill in England and Wales.\nBut the medical profession and disability rights groups, among others, argue that the law should not be changed because it is there to protect the vulnerable in society.\nIn other countries, such as Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, legislation has been introduced to allow assisted dying. France is considering a possible introduction of similar legislation, although there is opposition from its medical ethics council.\nCampaign group Dignity in Dying predicts that a lot more countries will follow suit.\nThe Bishop of Carlisle, the Right Reverend James Newcome, said Lord Carey's comments would not influence any vote by bishops in the House of Lords.\n\"The general synod has debated it and come to a conclusion. That's the position to which we're sticking.\"\nBut Lord Carey did received support from Rabbi Jonathan Romain, an inter-faith leader for campaign group Dignity in Dying.\nHe said the experience in the US state of Oregon - where assisted dying became legal in 1997 - showed \"very few people\" would use the right to get help to end their lives.\nThe Church of England said in a statement that its governing body, the General Synod, had passed a motion on the issue in February 2012.\nThe motion reaffirmed the Church's \"support for the current law on assisted suicide as a means of contributing to a just and compassionate society in which vulnerable people are protected\".\nAnd Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin, who is the Speaker's chaplain in the House of Commons, said having an assisted suicide law would sanitise death.\n\"I just happen to believe that matters of life and death in that way is not for us to play with. There are lots and lots of vulnerable people out there... you cannot make a law that is going to have a serious impact on a majority of people.\"\nDr Peter Saunders, chief executive of the Christian Medical Fellowship said he was concerned about vulnerable people being exploited.\n\"We've got to think about the people who are going to feel a duty to end their lives so as not to be a burden to others.\n\"I'm worried about the disabled people, the depressed and elderly, who are going to be put at danger by this bill which really just has eligibility criteria and not safeguards.\"",
