(CNN)He was known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that's devoted blood and resources to attacking it. But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was ""likely a separate"" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included ""providing aid and comfort"" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists."" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. ""Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,"" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called ""a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name."" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" he said. ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, ""the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,"" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

Crucible thoroughbreds John Higgins and Graeme Dott led the Scottish charge on Sunday at the Betfred World Championship. Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.'

(CNN)He was known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that's devoted blood and resources to attacking it. But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was ""likely a separate"" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included ""providing aid and comfort"" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists."" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. ""Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,"" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called ""a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name."" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" he said. ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, ""the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,"" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child.

Crucible thoroughbreds John Higgins and Graeme Dott led the Scottish charge on Sunday at the Betfred World Championship. Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form.

Crucible thoroughbreds John Higgins and Graeme Dott led the Scottish charge on Sunday at the Betfred World Championship. Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.'

(CNN)He was known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that's devoted blood and resources to attacking it. But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was ""likely a separate"" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included ""providing aid and comfort"" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists."" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. ""Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,"" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called ""a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name."" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" he said. ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, ""the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,"" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included ""providing aid and comfort"" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists."" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. ""Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,"" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called ""a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name."" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" he said. ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, ""the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,"" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

Crucible thoroughbreds John Higgins and Graeme Dott led the Scottish charge on Sunday at the Betfred World Championship. Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.'

President Barack Obama invited the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots to the White House on Thursday - but couldn't help but get one last deflategate joke in. The president opened his speech on the South Lawn by remarking 'that whole (deflategate) story got blown out of proportion,' referring to an investigation that 11 out of 12 footballs used in the AFC Championship game were under-inflated. But then came the zinger: 'I usually tell a bunch of jokes at these events, but with the Patriots in town I was worried that 11 out of 12 of them would fall flat.' Scroll down for video . Boo! Hiss!

Obama also quipped that he wished Chicago could learn something from Boston's championship-winning ways . Disapproval rating: Head coach Bill Belichick gives the thumbs down after Obama cracked a de-flate gate joke that left the whole team groaning . Obama received a custom jersey and a custom football from the team at the White House on Thursday . The Patriots assembled behind him groaned.

Missing from the occasion, though was the Super Bowl MVP and the team's biggest star - Tom Brady. A spokesman for the team cited 'prior family commitments' as the reason Brady, 37, didn't attend the ceremony. Sports commentators, including retired football great Boomer Esiason, speculated that Brady snubbed Obama because he's from the 'wrong political party.' The superstar athlete has been to the White House before. He does have three other Super Bowl rings, afterall. But all the prior championships were under the Bush Administration. February's win was the first for the Patriots since Obama took office. Brady has also met Obama at least once before, as well.

Rangers have promised to probe claims Mike Ashley has grabbed control of the club's badges. Reports emerged on social media on Thursday afternoon suggesting the Newcastle United owner was now the official owner of the Light Blues trademarks - including the 'Ready' badge and mascot Broxi Bear.

Rangers have promised to probe claims Mike Ashley has grabbed control of the club's badges . Reports emerged  suggesting the Newcastle  owner was now the official owner of the Light Blues trademarks . But now Dave King's new regime have promised a speedy investigation after documents appeared on the government-run Intellectual Property Office (IPO) website showing the club's trademarks were now controlled by SportsDirect.com Retail Ltd. In a statement a club spokesman said: 'The board is currently conducting a review of all contractual documentation but this particular issue has become a matter of urgency.' News that Ashley has seized hold of more treasured assets will worry the Ibrox faithful. The Londoner is already vastly unpopular after grabbing hold of a 75 per cent share of the club's retail income with his loan deal. Dave King's new regime have promised a speedy investigation into the claims surrounding Ashley . The IPO site confirm the transfer from Rangers Football Club Ltd to Sports Direct was fully assigned on March 25 - less than three weeks after former chief executive and Ashley ally Derek Llambias and finance director Barry Leach, a former Sports Direct executive, were removed at a general meeting called by King. Yet Interim chairman Paul Murray announced two days later that the new board had held 'no discussions with Mike Ashley or Sports Direct'. Rangers announced last week that if they gain promotion to the Premiership, they will have to pay Newcastle £500,000 as part of the deal which saw five Magpies youngsters move to Ibrox on loan.

(CNN)He was known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that's devoted blood and resources to attacking it. But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was ""likely a separate"" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included ""providing aid and comfort"" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists."" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. ""Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,"" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called ""a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name."" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.

Now there is an article: (CNN)He was known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that's devoted blood and resources to attacking it. But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was ""likely a separate"" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included ""providing aid and comfort"" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists."" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. ""Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,"" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called ""a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name."" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" he said. ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, ""the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,"" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.'

President Barack Obama invited the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots to the White House on Thursday - but couldn't help but get one last deflategate joke in. The president opened his speech on the South Lawn by remarking 'that whole (deflategate) story got blown out of proportion,' referring to an investigation that 11 out of 12 footballs used in the AFC Championship game were under-inflated. But then came the zinger: 'I usually tell a bunch of jokes at these events, but with the Patriots in town I was worried that 11 out of 12 of them would fall flat.' Scroll down for video . Boo! Hiss! President Barack Obama elicited groans and a thumbs down from head coach Bill Belichick after cracking a deflategate joke while honoring the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots . Obama also quipped that he wished Chicago could learn something from Boston's championship-winning ways . Disapproval rating: Head coach Bill Belichick gives the thumbs down after Obama cracked a de-flate gate joke that left the whole team groaning . Obama received a custom jersey and a custom football from the team at the White House on Thursday . The Patriots assembled behind him groaned. Coach Bill Belichick, who is notoriously humorless, responded by giving the president a thumbs down. Obama was flanked by Belichick and billionaire Patriots owner Bob Kraft. Missing from the occasion, though was the Super Bowl MVP and the team's biggest star - Tom Brady. A spokesman for the team cited 'prior family commitments' as the reason Brady, 37, didn't attend the ceremony. Sports commentators, including retired football great Boomer Esiason, speculated that Brady snubbed Obama because he's from the 'wrong political party.' The superstar athlete has been to the White House before. He does have three other Super Bowl rings, afterall. But all the prior championships were under the Bush Administration. February's win was the first for the Patriots since Obama took office. Brady has also met Obama at least once before, as well. He was pictured with the then-US Senator  at the 2005 White House Correspondents dinner.

Brady led the Patriots to his fourth Super Bowl victory in February after defeating the Seattle Seahawks 28-24. Despite his arm and movement being somewhat diminished by age, Brady's leadership and calm under pressure also won him Super Bowl MVP - his third.

Crucible thoroughbreds John Higgins and Graeme Dott led the Scottish charge on Sunday at the Betfred World Championship. Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.' Graeme Dott plays a shot during his match against Ricky Walden during the Betfred World Championships .

President Barack Obama invited the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots to the White House on Thursday - but couldn't help but get one last deflategate joke in. The president opened his speech on the South Lawn by remarking 'that whole (deflategate) story got blown out of proportion,' referring to an investigation that 11 out of 12 footballs used in the AFC Championship game were under-inflated. But then came the zinger: 'I usually tell a bunch of jokes at these events, but with the Patriots in town I was worried that 11 out of 12 of them would fall flat.' Scroll down for video . Boo! Hiss! President Barack Obama elicited groans and a thumbs down from head coach Bill Belichick after cracking a deflategate joke while honoring the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots . Obama also quipped that he wished Chicago could learn something from Boston's championship-winning ways . Disapproval rating: Head coach Bill Belichick gives the thumbs down after Obama cracked a de-flate gate joke that left the whole team groaning . Obama received a custom jersey and a custom football from the team at the White House on Thursday . The Patriots assembled behind him groaned. Coach Bill Belichick, who is notoriously humorless, responded by giving the president a thumbs down. Obama was flanked by Belichick and billionaire Patriots owner Bob Kraft. Missing from the occasion, though was the Super Bowl MVP and the team's biggest star - Tom Brady. A spokesman for the team cited 'prior family commitments' as the reason Brady, 37, didn't attend the ceremony. Sports commentators, including retired football great Boomer Esiason, speculated that Brady snubbed Obama because he's from the 'wrong political party.' The superstar athlete has been to the White House before. He does have three other Super Bowl rings, afterall. But all the prior championships were under the Bush Administration. February's win was the first for the Patriots since Obama took office. Brady has also met Obama at least once before, as well. He was pictured with the then-US Senator  at the 2005 White House Correspondents dinner. Showoffs: The New England Patriots gathered the team's four Super Bowl trophies won under Coach Bill Belichick (right, next to President Barack Obama). Brady won his fourth Super Bowl ring in February - and his first since President Obama took office . Tom Brady met President Barack Obama at least once. He is pictured here with the then-US Senator and rival quarterback Donovan McNabb in 2005 . It's not clear what Brady's prior commitment was. His supermodel wife Gisele Bündchen, usually active on social media, gives no hint where the family is today if not in Washington. Brady led the Patriots to his fourth Super Bowl victory in February after defeating the Seattle Seahawks 28-24. Despite his arm and movement being somewhat diminished by age, Brady's leadership and calm under pressure also won him Super Bowl MVP - his third. Whatever is taking up Brady's time this week, he made time next week to be ringside at the Floyd Mayweather Jr.-Manny Pacquiao fight in Las Vegas next weekend. According to Sport Illustrated, Brady appealed directly to CBS president Les Moonves for tickets to the much-touted matchup.

Rangers have promised to probe claims Mike Ashley has grabbed control of the club's badges. Reports emerged on social media on Thursday afternoon suggesting the Newcastle United owner was now the official owner of the Light Blues trademarks - including the 'Ready' badge and mascot Broxi Bear. The Sports Direct tycoon had been given security over the icons and logos as part of the £5million loan handed to the previous Gers board in January. Rangers have promised to probe claims Mike Ashley has grabbed control of the club's badges . Reports emerged  suggesting the Newcastle  owner was now the official owner of the Light Blues trademarks . But now Dave King's new regime have promised a speedy investigation after documents appeared on the government-run Intellectual Property Office (IPO) website showing the club's trademarks were now controlled by SportsDirect.com Retail Ltd. In a statement a club spokesman said: 'The board is currently conducting a review of all contractual documentation but this particular issue has become a matter of urgency.' News that Ashley has seized hold of more treasured assets will worry the Ibrox faithful. The Londoner is already vastly unpopular after grabbing hold of a 75 per cent share of the club's retail income with his loan deal. Dave King's new regime have promised a speedy investigation into the claims surrounding Ashley . The IPO site confirm the transfer from Rangers Football Club Ltd to Sports Direct was fully assigned on March 25 - less than three weeks after former chief executive and Ashley ally Derek Llambias and finance director Barry Leach, a former Sports Direct executive, were removed at a general meeting called by King. Yet Interim chairman Paul Murray announced two days later that the new board had held 'no discussions with Mike Ashley or Sports Direct'. Rangers announced last week that if they gain promotion to the Premiership, they will have to pay Newcastle £500,000 as part of the deal which saw five Magpies youngsters move to Ibrox on loan. Ashley was given security over the icons and logos as part of the £5m loan handed to the previous board .

(CNN)He was known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that's devoted blood and resources to attacking it. But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was ""likely a separate"" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included ""providing aid and comfort"" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists."" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. ""Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,"" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called ""a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name."" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" he said. ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, ""the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,"" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

(CNN)He was known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that's devoted blood and resources to attacking it. But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was ""likely a separate"" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included ""providing aid and comfort"" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists."" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. ""Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,"" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called ""a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name."" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" he said. ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, ""the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,"" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

Crucible thoroughbreds John Higgins and Graeme Dott led the Scottish charge on Sunday at the Betfred World Championship. Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.'

President Barack Obama invited the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots to the White House on Thursday - but couldn't help but get one last deflategate joke in. The president opened his speech on the South Lawn by remarking 'that whole (deflategate) story got blown out of proportion,' referring to an investigation that 11 out of 12 footballs used in the AFC Championship game were under-inflated. But then came the zinger: 'I usually tell a bunch of jokes at these events, but with the Patriots in town I was worried that 11 out of 12 of them would fall flat.' Scroll down for video . Boo! Hiss! President Barack Obama elicited groans and a thumbs down from head coach Bill Belichick after cracking a deflategate joke while honoring the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots . Obama also quipped that he wished Chicago could learn something from Boston's championship-winning ways . Disapproval rating: Head coach Bill Belichick gives the thumbs down after Obama cracked a de-flate gate joke that left the whole team groaning . Obama received a custom jersey and a custom football from the team at the White House on Thursday . The Patriots assembled behind him groaned. Coach Bill Belichick, who is notoriously humorless, responded by giving the president a thumbs down. Obama was flanked by Belichick and billionaire Patriots owner Bob Kraft. Missing from the occasion, though was the Super Bowl MVP and the team's biggest star - Tom Brady. A spokesman for the team cited 'prior family commitments' as the reason Brady, 37, didn't attend the ceremony. Sports commentators, including retired football great Boomer Esiason, speculated that Brady snubbed Obama because he's from the 'wrong political party.' The superstar athlete has been to the White House before. He does have three other Super Bowl rings, afterall. But all the prior championships were under the Bush Administration. February's win was the first for the Patriots since Obama took office. Brady has also met Obama at least once before, as well. He was pictured with the then-US Senator  at the 2005 White House Correspondents dinner. Showoffs: The New England Patriots gathered the team's four Super Bowl trophies won under Coach Bill Belichick (right, next to President Barack Obama). Brady won his fourth Super Bowl ring in February - and his first since President Obama took office . Tom Brady met President Barack Obama at least once. He is pictured here with the then-US Senator and rival quarterback Donovan McNabb in 2005 . It's not clear what Brady's prior commitment was. His supermodel wife Gisele Bündchen, usually active on social media, gives no hint where the family is today if not in Washington. Brady led the Patriots to his fourth Super Bowl victory in February after defeating the Seattle Seahawks 28-24. Despite his arm and movement being somewhat diminished by age, Brady's leadership and calm under pressure also won him Super Bowl MVP - his third. Whatever is taking up Brady's time this week, he made time next week to be ringside at the Floyd Mayweather Jr.-Manny Pacquiao fight in Las Vegas next weekend. According to Sport Illustrated, Brady appealed directly to CBS president Les Moonves for tickets to the much-touted matchup. Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski couldn't help but mug for the camera as the Commander in Chief gave a speech . Obama walks with billionaire Patriots owner Bob Kraft and coach Bellichick to the speech . Secretary of State John Kerry, a former Massachusetts US Senator, greets Belichick's girlfriend Linda Holliday at the ceremony . Brady went to the White House to meet President George W Bush after winning the Super Bowl in 2005 and in 2004. He's not going to be there this year . Patriots players Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola snap pics in the White House before meeting President Barack Obama on Thursday .

Rangers have promised to probe claims Mike Ashley has grabbed control of the club's badges. Reports emerged on social media on Thursday afternoon suggesting the Newcastle United owner was now the official owner of the Light Blues trademarks - including the 'Ready' badge and mascot Broxi Bear. The Sports Direct tycoon had been given security over the icons and logos as part of the £5million loan handed to the previous Gers board in January. Rangers have promised to probe claims Mike Ashley has grabbed control of the club's badges . Reports emerged  suggesting the Newcastle  owner was now the official owner of the Light Blues trademarks . But now Dave King's new regime have promised a speedy investigation after documents appeared on the government-run Intellectual Property Office (IPO) website showing the club's trademarks were now controlled by SportsDirect.com Retail Ltd. In a statement a club spokesman said: 'The board is currently conducting a review of all contractual documentation but this particular issue has become a matter of urgency.' News that Ashley has seized hold of more treasured assets will worry the Ibrox faithful. The Londoner is already vastly unpopular after grabbing hold of a 75 per cent share of the club's retail income with his loan deal. Dave King's new regime have promised a speedy investigation into the claims surrounding Ashley . The IPO site confirm the transfer from Rangers Football Club Ltd to Sports Direct was fully assigned on March 25 - less than three weeks after former chief executive and Ashley ally Derek Llambias and finance director Barry Leach, a former Sports Direct executive, were removed at a general meeting called by King. Yet Interim chairman Paul Murray announced two days later that the new board had held 'no discussions with Mike Ashley or Sports Direct'. Rangers announced last week that if they gain promotion to the Premiership, they will have to pay Newcastle £500,000 as part of the deal which saw five Magpies youngsters move to Ibrox on loan. Ashley was given security over the icons and logos as part of the £5m loan handed to the previous board .

(CNN)He was known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that's devoted blood and resources to attacking it. But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was ""likely a separate"" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included ""providing aid and comfort"" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists."" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. ""Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,"" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called ""a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name."" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" he said. ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, ""the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,"" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

Crucible thoroughbreds John Higgins and Graeme Dott led the Scottish charge on Sunday at the Betfred World Championship. Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost.

Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost.

(CNN)He was known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that's devoted blood and resources to attacking it. But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was ""likely a separate"" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included ""providing aid and comfort"" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists."" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. ""Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,"" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called ""a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name."" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" he said. ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, ""the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,"" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well.

(CNN)He was known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that's devoted blood and resources to attacking it. But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was ""likely a separate"" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included ""providing aid and comfort"" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists."" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. ""Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,"" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called ""a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name."" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" he said. ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, ""the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,"" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included ""providing aid and comfort"" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists."" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. ""Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,"" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called ""a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name."" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" he said. ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, ""the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,"" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

Rangers have promised to probe claims Mike Ashley has grabbed control of the club's badges. Reports emerged on social media on Thursday afternoon suggesting the Newcastle United owner was now the official owner of the Light Blues trademarks - including the 'Ready' badge and mascot Broxi Bear. The Sports Direct tycoon had been given security over the icons and logos as part of the £5million loan handed to the previous Gers board in January. Rangers have promised to probe claims Mike Ashley has grabbed control of the club's badges . Reports emerged  suggesting the Newcastle  owner was now the official owner of the Light Blues trademarks . But now Dave King's new regime have promised a speedy investigation after documents appeared on the government-run Intellectual Property Office (IPO) website showing the club's trademarks were now controlled by SportsDirect.com Retail Ltd. In a statement a club spokesman said: 'The board is currently conducting a review of all contractual documentation but this particular issue has become a matter of urgency.' News that Ashley has seized hold of more treasured assets will worry the Ibrox faithful. The Londoner is already vastly unpopular after grabbing hold of a 75 per cent share of the club's retail income with his loan deal. Dave King's new regime have promised a speedy investigation into the claims surrounding Ashley . The IPO site confirm the transfer from Rangers Football Club Ltd to Sports Direct was fully assigned on March 25 - less than three weeks after former chief executive and Ashley ally Derek Llambias and finance director Barry Leach, a former Sports Direct executive, were removed at a general meeting called by King. Yet Interim chairman Paul Murray announced two days later that the new board had held 'no discussions with Mike Ashley or Sports Direct'. Rangers announced last week that if they gain promotion to the Premiership, they will have to pay Newcastle £500,000 as part of the deal which saw five Magpies youngsters move to Ibrox on loan.

But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was ""likely a separate"" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included ""providing aid and comfort"" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists."" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. ""Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,"" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called ""a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name."" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" he said. ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, ""the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,"" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy.

Article:
President Barack Obama invited the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots to the White House on Thursday - but couldn't help but get one last deflategate joke in. The president opened his speech on the South Lawn by remarking 'that whole (deflategate) story got blown out of proportion,' referring to an investigation that 11 out of 12 footballs used in the AFC Championship game were under-inflated. But then came the zinger: 'I usually tell a bunch of jokes at these events, but with the Patriots in town I was worried that 11 out of 12 of them would fall flat.' Scroll down for video . Boo! Hiss! President Barack Obama elicited groans and a thumbs down from head coach Bill Belichick after cracking a deflategate joke while honoring the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots . Obama also quipped that he wished Chicago could learn something from Boston's championship-winning ways . Disapproval rating: Head coach Bill Belichick gives the thumbs down after Obama cracked a de-flate gate joke that left the whole team groaning . Obama received a custom jersey and a custom football from the team at the White House on Thursday . The Patriots assembled behind him groaned. Coach Bill Belichick, who is notoriously humorless, responded by giving the president a thumbs down. Obama was flanked by Belichick and billionaire Patriots owner Bob Kraft. Missing from the occasion, though was the Super Bowl MVP and the team's biggest star - Tom Brady. A spokesman for the team cited 'prior family commitments' as the reason Brady, 37, didn't attend the ceremony. Sports commentators, including retired football great Boomer Esiason, speculated that Brady snubbed Obama because he's from the 'wrong political party.' The superstar athlete has been to the White House before. He does have three other Super Bowl rings, afterall. But all the prior championships were under the Bush Administration. February's win was the first for the Patriots since Obama took office. Brady has also met Obama at least once before, as well. He was pictured with the then-US Senator  at the 2005 White House Correspondents dinner. Showoffs: The New England Patriots gathered the team's four Super Bowl trophies won under Coach Bill Belichick (right, next to President Barack Obama). Brady won his fourth Super Bowl ring in February - and his first since President Obama took office . Tom Brady met President Barack Obama at least once. He is pictured here with the then-US Senator and rival quarterback Donovan McNabb in 2005 . It's not clear what Brady's prior commitment was. His supermodel wife Gisele Bündchen, usually active on social media, gives no hint where the family is today if not in Washington. Brady led the Patriots to his fourth Super Bowl victory in February after defeating the Seattle Seahawks 28-24. Despite his arm and movement being somewhat diminished by age, Brady's leadership and calm under pressure also won him Super Bowl MVP - his third. Whatever is taking up Brady's time this week, he made time next week to be ringside at the Floyd Mayweather Jr.-Manny Pacquiao fight in Las Vegas next weekend. According to Sport Illustrated, Brady appealed directly to CBS president Les Moonves for tickets to the much-touted matchup. Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski couldn't help but mug for the camera as the Commander in Chief gave a speech . Obama walks with billionaire Patriots owner Bob Kraft and coach Bellichick to the speech .

President Barack Obama invited the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots to the White House on Thursday - but couldn't help but get one last deflategate joke in. The president opened his speech on the South Lawn by remarking 'that whole (deflategate) story got blown out of proportion,' referring to an investigation that 11 out of 12 footballs used in the AFC Championship game were under-inflated. But then came the zinger: 'I usually tell a bunch of jokes at these events, but with the Patriots in town I was worried that 11 out of 12 of them would fall flat.' Scroll down for video . Boo! Hiss! President Barack Obama elicited groans and a thumbs down from head coach Bill Belichick after cracking a deflategate joke while honoring the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots . Obama also quipped that he wished Chicago could learn something from Boston's championship-winning ways . Disapproval rating: Head coach Bill Belichick gives the thumbs down after Obama cracked a de-flate gate joke that left the whole team groaning . Obama received a custom jersey and a custom football from the team at the White House on Thursday . The Patriots assembled behind him groaned. Coach Bill Belichick, who is notoriously humorless, responded by giving the president a thumbs down. Obama was flanked by Belichick and billionaire Patriots owner Bob Kraft. Missing from the occasion, though was the Super Bowl MVP and the team's biggest star - Tom Brady. A spokesman for the team cited 'prior family commitments' as the reason Brady, 37, didn't attend the ceremony. Sports commentators, including retired football great Boomer Esiason, speculated that Brady snubbed Obama because he's from the 'wrong political party.' The superstar athlete has been to the White House before. He does have three other Super Bowl rings, afterall. But all the prior championships were under the Bush Administration. February's win was the first for the Patriots since Obama took office. Brady has also met Obama at least once before, as well. He was pictured with the then-US Senator  at the 2005 White House Correspondents dinner. Showoffs: The New England Patriots gathered the team's four Super Bowl trophies won under Coach Bill Belichick (right, next to President Barack Obama). Brady won his fourth Super Bowl ring in February - and his first since President Obama took office . Tom Brady met President Barack Obama at least once. He is pictured here with the then-US Senator and rival quarterback Donovan McNabb in 2005 . It's not clear what Brady's prior commitment was. His supermodel wife Gisele Bündchen, usually active on social media, gives no hint where the family is today if not in Washington. Brady led the Patriots to his fourth Super Bowl victory in February after defeating the Seattle Seahawks 28-24. Despite his arm and movement being somewhat diminished by age, Brady's leadership and calm under pressure also won him Super Bowl MVP - his third. Whatever is taking up Brady's time this week, he made time next week to be ringside at the Floyd Mayweather Jr.-Manny Pacquiao fight in Las Vegas next weekend. According to Sport Illustrated, Brady appealed directly to CBS president Les Moonves for tickets to the much-touted matchup.

Rangers have promised to probe claims Mike Ashley has grabbed control of the club's badges. Reports emerged on social media on Thursday afternoon suggesting the Newcastle United owner was now the official owner of the Light Blues trademarks - including the 'Ready' badge and mascot Broxi Bear. The Sports Direct tycoon had been given security over the icons and logos as part of the £5million loan handed to the previous Gers board in January. Rangers have promised to probe claims Mike Ashley has grabbed control of the club's badges . Reports emerged  suggesting the Newcastle  owner was now the official owner of the Light Blues trademarks . But now Dave King's new regime have promised a speedy investigation after documents appeared on the government-run Intellectual Property Office (IPO) website showing the club's trademarks were now controlled by SportsDirect.com Retail Ltd. In a statement a club spokesman said: 'The board is currently conducting a review of all contractual documentation but this particular issue has become a matter of urgency.' News that Ashley has seized hold of more treasured assets will worry the Ibrox faithful. The Londoner is already vastly unpopular after grabbing hold of a 75 per cent share of the club's retail income with his loan deal. Dave King's new regime have promised a speedy investigation into the claims surrounding Ashley . The IPO site confirm the transfer from Rangers Football Club Ltd to Sports Direct was fully assigned on March 25 - less than three weeks after former chief executive and Ashley ally Derek Llambias and finance director Barry Leach, a former Sports Direct executive, were removed at a general meeting called by King. Yet Interim chairman Paul Murray announced two days later that the new board had held 'no discussions with Mike Ashley or Sports Direct'. Rangers announced last week that if they gain promotion to the Premiership, they will have to pay Newcastle £500,000 as part of the deal which saw five Magpies youngsters move to Ibrox on loan. Ashley was given security over the icons and logos as part of the £5m loan handed to the previous board .

Article:
(CNN)He was known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that's devoted blood and resources to attacking it. But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was ""likely a separate"" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included ""providing aid and comfort"" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists."" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. ""Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,"" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called ""a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name."" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" he said. ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, ""the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,"" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

Crucible thoroughbreds John Higgins and Graeme Dott led the Scottish charge on Sunday at the Betfred World Championship. Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.' Graeme Dott plays a shot during his match against Ricky Walden during the Betfred World Championships .

Crucible thoroughbreds John Higgins and Graeme Dott led the Scottish charge on Sunday at the Betfred World Championship. Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.' Graeme Dott plays a shot during his match against Ricky Walden during the Betfred World Championships .

Article:
President Barack Obama invited the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots to the White House on Thursday - but couldn't help but get one last deflategate joke in. The president opened his speech on the South Lawn by remarking 'that whole (deflategate) story got blown out of proportion,' referring to an investigation that 11 out of 12 footballs used in the AFC Championship game were under-inflated. But then came the zinger: 'I usually tell a bunch of jokes at these events, but with the Patriots in town I was worried that 11 out of 12 of them would fall flat.' Scroll down for video . Boo! Hiss! President Barack Obama elicited groans and a thumbs down from head coach Bill Belichick after cracking a deflategate joke while honoring the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots . Obama also quipped that he wished Chicago could learn something from Boston's championship-winning ways . Disapproval rating: Head coach Bill Belichick gives the thumbs down after Obama cracked a de-flate gate joke that left the whole team groaning . Obama received a custom jersey and a custom football from the team at the White House on Thursday . The Patriots assembled behind him groaned. Coach Bill Belichick, who is notoriously humorless, responded by giving the president a thumbs down. Obama was flanked by Belichick and billionaire Patriots owner Bob Kraft. Missing from the occasion, though was the Super Bowl MVP and the team's biggest star - Tom Brady. A spokesman for the team cited 'prior family commitments' as the reason Brady, 37, didn't attend the ceremony. Sports commentators, including retired football great Boomer Esiason, speculated that Brady snubbed Obama because he's from the 'wrong political party.' The superstar athlete has been to the White House before. He does have three other Super Bowl rings, afterall. But all the prior championships were under the Bush Administration. February's win was the first for the Patriots since Obama took office. Brady has also met Obama at least once before, as well. He was pictured with the then-US Senator  at the 2005 White House Correspondents dinner. Showoffs: The New England Patriots gathered the team's four Super Bowl trophies won under Coach Bill Belichick (right, next to President Barack Obama). Brady won his fourth Super Bowl ring in February - and his first since President Obama took office . Tom Brady met President Barack Obama at least once. He is pictured here with the then-US Senator and rival quarterback Donovan McNabb in 2005 . It's not clear what Brady's prior commitment was. His supermodel wife Gisele Bündchen, usually active on social media, gives no hint where the family is today if not in Washington. Brady led the Patriots to his fourth Super Bowl victory in February after defeating the Seattle Seahawks 28-24. Despite his arm and movement being somewhat diminished by age, Brady's leadership and calm under pressure also won him Super Bowl MVP - his third. Whatever is taking up Brady's time this week, he made time next week to be ringside at the Floyd Mayweather Jr.-Manny Pacquiao fight in Las Vegas next weekend. According to Sport Illustrated, Brady appealed directly to CBS president Les Moonves for tickets to the much-touted matchup. Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski couldn't help but mug for the camera as the Commander in Chief gave a speech .

Article:
(CNN)He was known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that's devoted blood and resources to attacking it. But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was ""likely a separate"" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included ""providing aid and comfort"" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists."" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. ""Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,"" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called ""a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name."" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" he said. ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, ""the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,"" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

""Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,"" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called ""a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name."" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" he said. ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, ""the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,"" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

Crucible thoroughbreds John Higgins and Graeme Dott led the Scottish charge on Sunday at the Betfred World Championship. Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago.

But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was ""likely a separate"" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included ""providing aid and comfort"" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists."" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. ""Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,"" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called ""a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name."" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" he said. ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card.

In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, ""the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,"" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya.

(CNN)He was known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that's devoted blood and resources to attacking it. But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was ""likely a separate"" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included ""providing aid and comfort"" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists."" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. ""Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,"" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called ""a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name."" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" he said. ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, ""the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,"" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

News that Ashley has seized hold of more treasured assets will worry the Ibrox faithful.

(CNN)He was known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that's devoted blood and resources to attacking it. But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was ""likely a separate"" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included ""providing aid and comfort"" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists."" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. ""Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,"" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called ""a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name."" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" he said. ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, ""the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,"" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

Crucible thoroughbreds John Higgins and Graeme Dott led the Scottish charge on Sunday at the Betfred World Championship. Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records.

President Barack Obama invited the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots to the White House on Thursday - but couldn't help but get one last deflategate joke in. The president opened his speech on the South Lawn by remarking 'that whole (deflategate) story got blown out of proportion,' referring to an investigation that 11 out of 12 footballs used in the AFC Championship game were under-inflated. But then came the zinger: 'I usually tell a bunch of jokes at these events, but with the Patriots in town I was worried that 11 out of 12 of them would fall flat.' Scroll down for video . Boo! Hiss! President Barack Obama elicited groans and a thumbs down from head coach Bill Belichick after cracking a deflategate joke while honoring the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots . Obama also quipped that he wished Chicago could learn something from Boston's championship-winning ways . Disapproval rating: Head coach Bill Belichick gives the thumbs down after Obama cracked a de-flate gate joke that left the whole team groaning . Obama received a custom jersey and a custom football from the team at the White House on Thursday . The Patriots assembled behind him groaned. Coach Bill Belichick, who is notoriously humorless, responded by giving the president a thumbs down. Obama was flanked by Belichick and billionaire Patriots owner Bob Kraft. Missing from the occasion, though was the Super Bowl MVP and the team's biggest star - Tom Brady. A spokesman for the team cited 'prior family commitments' as the reason Brady, 37, didn't attend the ceremony. Sports commentators, including retired football great Boomer Esiason, speculated that Brady snubbed Obama because he's from the 'wrong political party.' The superstar athlete has been to the White House before. He does have three other Super Bowl rings, afterall. But all the prior championships were under the Bush Administration. February's win was the first for the Patriots since Obama took office. Brady has also met Obama at least once before, as well. He was pictured with the then-US Senator  at the 2005 White House Correspondents dinner. Showoffs: The New England Patriots gathered the team's four Super Bowl trophies won under Coach Bill Belichick (right, next to President Barack Obama). Brady won his fourth Super Bowl ring in February - and his first since President Obama took office . Tom Brady met President Barack Obama at least once. He is pictured here with the then-US Senator and rival quarterback Donovan McNabb in 2005 . It's not clear what Brady's prior commitment was. His supermodel wife Gisele Bündchen, usually active on social media, gives no hint where the family is today if not in Washington. Brady led the Patriots to his fourth Super Bowl victory in February after defeating the Seattle Seahawks 28-24. Despite his arm and movement being somewhat diminished by age, Brady's leadership and calm under pressure also won him Super Bowl MVP - his third. Whatever is taking up Brady's time this week, he made time next week to be ringside at the Floyd Mayweather Jr.-Manny Pacquiao fight in Las Vegas next weekend. According to Sport Illustrated, Brady appealed directly to CBS president Les Moonves for tickets to the much-touted matchup.

The latest protests are a reaction to him sacking two finance ministers last week, further damaging confidence in the economy.
This comes on top of claims of widespread corruption, recent student protests and a succession battle in the governing African National Congress.
The marchers are using the hasthag #ZumaMustFall on social media.
The #ZumaMustFall hashtag is a modification of #FeesMustFall which was used to organise protests against a rise in university fees.
Before that, #RhodesMustFall was used to demand a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town's campus.
""It feels like the start of something big,"" a woman in her 50s called Lianda told me.
It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising.
For her it was important to join the demonstrations with her teenage daughters ""for the sake of their future"". So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability.
But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC.
Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president.
Yet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC.
This may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder.
The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year.
However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption.
Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned.
The appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night.

Greyhound protection group Caged North West was first alerted after spotting a photograph of the dog's body that was shared on the internet.
It then discovered the animal behind a water tank a few yards from Main Street.
The group later placed CCTV in the area, which recorded footage of a person with a dog searching the small area of ground behind the water tank.

The veteran broadcaster died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 77.
The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of ""a true son of Limerick"", the city's mayor Liam Galvin said.
Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: ""He was the absolute governor.""
A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London.
In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners.
At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: ""He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years.
""All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident.
""And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.
""Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.""
Evans described Sir Terry as his ""radio dad"" and said that Radio 2 was ""in disbelief and shock"".
""He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,"" added Evans. ""He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.""
BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry ""one of the greatest broadcasters of our age"".
""Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,"" he said.
""You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.
""But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.""
Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a ""wonderful human being"".
""I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,"" he said.
Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was ""stunned"" at the news and that his condolences were ""very much with Helen and the family"".
Sir Terry died surrounded by his family ""after a short but brave battle with cancer"", a statement released by his family said.
He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.
An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.
The city's mayor said: ""Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.
""The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.""
President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was ""always proud of his origins in Limerick"", and returned frequently to his native country.
Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was ""shocked"" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had ""put it out that he had a bad back"".
The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.
""I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money.
""For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,"" he added.
Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon.
Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.
He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.
From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.
The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or ""Terry's Old Geezers and Gals"".
Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.
BBC director general Lord Hall said: ""He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.""
Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was ""one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard"".
Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.
Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a ""radio genius"", saying: ""The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.""
Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.
The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: ""Such a special and funny man.
""A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.""
Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity.
Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: ""He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster.
""He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.""
Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later.
When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: ""The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you.
""When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine.""
Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015.

But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed.
What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts.
Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media.
Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason.
If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: ""Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.""
There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.
In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.
That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.
Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.
So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.
This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.
The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.
Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.
And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.
But the scandal is far from over.
Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.
And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.
""For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,"" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.
""I could never have imagined that.""
The treason investigation has now been suspended.
But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.
It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians ""to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient"".
Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.
What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?
The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.

""I could never have imagined that."" The treason investigation has now been suspended. But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings. It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians ""to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient"". Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions. What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?

The latest protests are a reaction to him sacking two finance ministers last week, further damaging confidence in the economy.
This comes on top of claims of widespread corruption, recent student protests and a succession battle in the governing African National Congress.
The marchers are using the hasthag #ZumaMustFall on social media.
The #ZumaMustFall hashtag is a modification of #FeesMustFall which was used to organise protests against a rise in university fees.
Before that, #RhodesMustFall was used to demand a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town's campus.
""It feels like the start of something big,"" a woman in her 50s called Lianda told me.
It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising.
For her it was important to join the demonstrations with her teenage daughters ""for the sake of their future"". So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability.
But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC.
Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president.
Yet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC.
This may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder.
The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year.
However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption.
Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned.
The appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night.","marchers using #ZumaMustFall hashtag to protest sacking of two finance ministers . comes on top of claims of widespread corruption, student protests and succession battle . the ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide last year .",62.43550387596903,0.1724,0.1034,0.125532922785824,42

Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: ""He was the absolute governor.""
A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London.
In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners.
At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: ""He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years.
""All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident.

""Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.""
Evans described Sir Terry as his ""radio dad"" and said that Radio 2 was ""in disbelief and shock"".
""He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,"" added Evans. ""He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.""
BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry ""one of the greatest broadcasters of our age"".
""Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,"" he said.
""You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.

Sir Terry died surrounded by his family ""after a short but brave battle with cancer"", a statement released by his family said.
He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.
An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.

But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed.
What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts.
Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media.
Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason.
If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: ""Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.""
There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.
In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.
That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.
Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.
So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.
This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.
The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.
Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.
And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.
But the scandal is far from over.
Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.
And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.
""For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,"" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.

In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.
That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.
Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.
So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.
This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.
The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.
Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.
And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.
But the scandal is far from over.
Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.
And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.
""For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,"" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.
""I could never have imagined that.""
The treason investigation has now been suspended.
But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.
It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians ""to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient"".
Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.
What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?
The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.

The latest protests are a reaction to him sacking two finance ministers last week, further damaging confidence in the economy.
This comes on top of claims of widespread corruption, recent student protests and a succession battle in the governing African National Congress.
The marchers are using the hasthag #ZumaMustFall on social media.
The #ZumaMustFall hashtag is a modification of #FeesMustFall which was used to organise protests against a rise in university fees.
Before that, #RhodesMustFall was used to demand a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town's campus.
""It feels like the start of something big,"" a woman in her 50s called Lianda told me.
It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising.
For her it was important to join the demonstrations with her teenage daughters ""for the sake of their future"". So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability.
But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC.
Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president.
Yet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC.
This may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder.
The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year.
However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption.
Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned.
The appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night.

Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: ""He was the absolute governor.""
A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London.
In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners.
At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: ""He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years.

Evans described Sir Terry as his ""radio dad"" and said that Radio 2 was ""in disbelief and shock"".

But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed.
What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts.
Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media.
Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason.
If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: ""Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.""
There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.
In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.
That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.
Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.
So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.

But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed.
What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts.
Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media.
Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason.
If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: ""Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.""
There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.
In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.
That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.
Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.
So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.
This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.
The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.
Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.
And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.
But the scandal is far from over.
Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.
And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.
""For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,"" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.
""I could never have imagined that.""
The treason investigation has now been suspended.
But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.
It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians ""to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient"".
Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.
What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?
The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.

The latest protests are a reaction to him sacking two finance ministers last week, further damaging confidence in the economy.
This comes on top of claims of widespread corruption, recent student protests and a succession battle in the governing African National Congress.
The marchers are using the hasthag #ZumaMustFall on social media.
The #ZumaMustFall hashtag is a modification of #FeesMustFall which was used to organise protests against a rise in university fees.
Before that, #RhodesMustFall was used to demand a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town's campus.
""It feels like the start of something big,"" a woman in her 50s called Lianda told me.
It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising.
For her it was important to join the demonstrations with her teenage daughters ""for the sake of their future"". So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability.
But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC.
Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president.
Yet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC.
This may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder.
The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year.
However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption.
Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned.
The appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night.

The female dog was discovered ""dumped like rubbish"" in the Overton area of Lancaster.
Racing greyhounds are tattooed on their right ears, and it is believed the ear was cut off to destroy identification information.
Campaigners are offering a £2,000 reward for information.
Greyhound protection group Caged North West was first alerted after spotting a photograph of the dog's body that was shared on the internet.
It then discovered the animal behind a water tank a few yards from Main Street.
The group later placed CCTV in the area, which recorded footage of a person with a dog searching the small area of ground behind the water tank.
Trudy Baker, of the Greytexploitations group, which has joined Caged North West to offer the reward, said it believed whoever dumped the dog had returned to the scene to remove the ear.
""It's incredibly sad but greyhounds are over-bred for the gambling industry, and the ones that no longer make the grade become disposable commodities,"" she said.
""We are hoping that this case ends in a prosecution.""
The campaigners said they would hand the CCTV footage to Lancashire Police.
A post-mortem examination of the animal was due to take place.

The veteran broadcaster died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 77.
The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of ""a true son of Limerick"", the city's mayor Liam Galvin said.
Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: ""He was the absolute governor.""
A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London.
In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners.
At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: ""He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years.
""All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident.
""And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.
""Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.""
Evans described Sir Terry as his ""radio dad"" and said that Radio 2 was ""in disbelief and shock"".
""He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,"" added Evans. ""He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.""
BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry ""one of the greatest broadcasters of our age"".
""Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,"" he said.
""You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.
""But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.""
Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a ""wonderful human being"".
""I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,"" he said.
Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was ""stunned"" at the news and that his condolences were ""very much with Helen and the family"".
Sir Terry died surrounded by his family ""after a short but brave battle with cancer"", a statement released by his family said.
He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.
An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.
The city's mayor said: ""Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.
""The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.""
President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was ""always proud of his origins in Limerick"", and returned frequently to his native country.
Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was ""shocked"" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had ""put it out that he had a bad back"".
The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.
""I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money.
""For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,"" he added.
Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon.
Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.
He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.
From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.
The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or ""Terry's Old Geezers and Gals"".
Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.
BBC director general Lord Hall said: ""He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.""
Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was ""one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard"".
Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.
Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a ""radio genius"", saying: ""The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.""
Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.
The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: ""Such a special and funny man.
""A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.""
Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity.
Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: ""He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster.
""He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.""
Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later.
When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: ""The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you.
""When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine.""
Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015.
The One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.

He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,"" he said. ""You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one. ""But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them."" Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a ""wonderful human being"". ""I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,"" he said. Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was ""stunned"" at the news and that his condolences were ""very much with Helen and the family"". Sir Terry died surrounded by his family ""after a short but brave battle with cancer"", a statement released by his family said. He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy. An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning. The city's mayor said: ""Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots. ""The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family."" President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was ""always proud of his origins in Limerick"", and returned frequently to his native country. Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was ""shocked"" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had ""put it out that he had a bad back"". The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin. ""I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money. ""For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,"" he added. Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon. Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance. He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event. From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan. The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or ""Terry's Old Geezers and Gals"". Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday. BBC director general Lord Hall said: ""He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family. For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family."" Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was ""one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard"". Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career. Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a ""radio genius"", saying: ""The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone."" Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account. The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: ""Such a special and funny man. ""A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter."" Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity. Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: ""He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster. ""He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it."" Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later. When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: ""The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you. ""When you tell me how essential I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine."" Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015. The One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.

Article: A rare snowstorm hit southern California yesterday, causing major traffic delays and school closures. Weather officials say it's the heaviest snowfall in the region in over 20 years. Overview: Southern California hit by rare snowstorm, closing schools and delaying traffic. Now there is an passage: But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed. What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts. Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media. Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason. If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: ""Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years."" There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik. In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up. That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century. Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press. So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful. This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare. The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll. Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation. And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor. But the scandal is far from over. Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place. And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities. ""For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,"" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD. ""I could never have imagined that."" The treason investigation has now been suspended. But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings. It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians ""to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient"". Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions. What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway? The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.

The latest protests are a reaction to him sacking two finance ministers last week, further damaging confidence in the economy.
This comes on top of claims of widespread corruption, recent student protests and a succession battle in the governing African National Congress.
The marchers are using the hasthag #ZumaMustFall on social media.
The #ZumaMustFall hashtag is a modification of #FeesMustFall which was used to organise protests against a rise in university fees.
Before that, #RhodesMustFall was used to demand a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town's campus.
""It feels like the start of something big,"" a woman in her 50s called Lianda told me.
It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising.
For her it was important to join the demonstrations with her teenage daughters ""for the sake of their future"". So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability.
But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC.
Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president.
Yet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC.
This may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder.
The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year.
However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption.
Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned.
The appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night.

The female dog was discovered ""dumped like rubbish"" in the Overton area of Lancaster.
Racing greyhounds are tattooed on their right ears, and it is believed the ear was cut off to destroy identification information.
Campaigners are offering a £2,000 reward for information.
Greyhound protection group Caged North West was first alerted after spotting a photograph of the dog's body that was shared on the internet.
It then discovered the animal behind a water tank a few yards from Main Street.
The group later placed CCTV in the area, which recorded footage of a person with a dog searching the small area of ground behind the water tank.
Trudy Baker, of the Greytexploitations group, which has joined Caged North West to offer the reward, said it believed whoever dumped the dog had returned to the scene to remove the ear.
""It's incredibly sad but greyhounds are over-bred for the gambling industry, and the ones that no longer make the grade become disposable commodities,"" she said.
""We are hoping that this case ends in a prosecution.""
The campaigners said they would hand the CCTV footage to Lancashire Police.
A post-mortem examination of the animal was due to take place.

The veteran broadcaster died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 77.
The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of ""a true son of Limerick"", the city's mayor Liam Galvin said.
Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: ""He was the absolute governor.""
A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London.
In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners.
At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: ""He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years.
""All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident.
""And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.
""Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.""

But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed.
What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts.
Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media.
Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason.
If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: ""Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.""
There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.
In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.
That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.

The latest protests are a reaction to him sacking two finance ministers last week, further damaging confidence in the economy.
This comes on top of claims of widespread corruption, recent student protests and a succession battle in the governing African National Congress.
The marchers are using the hasthag #ZumaMustFall on social media.
The #ZumaMustFall hashtag is a modification of #FeesMustFall which was used to organise protests against a rise in university fees.
Before that, #RhodesMustFall was used to demand a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town's campus.
""It feels like the start of something big,"" a woman in her 50s called Lianda told me.
It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising.
For her it was important to join the demonstrations with her teenage daughters ""for the sake of their future"". So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability.
But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC.
Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president.
Yet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC.
This may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder.
The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year.
However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption.
Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned.
The appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night.

The female dog was discovered ""dumped like rubbish"" in the Overton area of Lancaster.
Racing greyhounds are tattooed on their right ears, and it is believed the ear was cut off to destroy identification information.
Campaigners are offering a £2,000 reward for information.
Greyhound protection group Caged North West was first alerted after spotting a photograph of the dog's body that was shared on the internet.
It then discovered the animal behind a water tank a few yards from Main Street.
The group later placed CCTV in the area, which recorded footage of a person with a dog searching the small area of ground behind the water tank.
Trudy Baker, of the Greytexploitations group, which has joined Caged North West to offer the reward, said it believed whoever dumped the dog had returned to the scene to remove the ear.
""It's incredibly sad but greyhounds are over-bred for the gambling industry, and the ones that no longer make the grade become disposable commodities,"" she said.
""We are hoping that this case ends in a prosecution.""
The campaigners said they would hand the CCTV footage to Lancashire Police.
A post-mortem examination of the animal was due to take place.

The veteran broadcaster died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 77.
The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of ""a true son of Limerick"", the city's mayor Liam Galvin said.
Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: ""He was the absolute governor.""
A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London.
In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners.
At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: ""He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years.
""All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident.
""And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.
""Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.""
Evans described Sir Terry as his ""radio dad"" and said that Radio 2 was ""in disbelief and shock"".
""He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,"" added Evans. ""He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.""
BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry ""one of the greatest broadcasters of our age"".
""Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,"" he said.
""You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.
""But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.""
Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a ""wonderful human being"".
""I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,"" he said.
Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was ""stunned"" at the news and that his condolences were ""very much with Helen and the family"".
Sir Terry died surrounded by his family ""after a short but brave battle with cancer"", a statement released by his family said.
He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.
An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.
The city's mayor said: ""Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.
""The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.""
President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was ""always proud of his origins in Limerick"", and returned frequently to his native country.
Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was ""shocked"" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had ""put it out that he had a bad back"".
The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.
""I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money.
""For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,"" he added.
Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon.
Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.
He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.
From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.
The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or ""Terry's Old Geezers and Gals"".
Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.
BBC director general Lord Hall said: ""He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.""
Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was ""one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard"".
Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.
Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a ""radio genius"", saying: ""The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.""
Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.
The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: ""Such a special and funny man.
""A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.""
Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity.
Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: ""He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster.
""He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.""
Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later.
When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: ""The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you.
""When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine.""
Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015.
The One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.

Now there is an article:

But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed.
What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts.
Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media.
Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason.
If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: ""Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.""
There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.
In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.
That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.
Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.
So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.
This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.
The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.
Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.
And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.
But the scandal is far from over.
Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.
And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.
""For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,"" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.
""I could never have imagined that.""
The treason investigation has now been suspended.
But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.
It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians ""to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient"".
Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.
What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?
The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.

Now there is an article:

But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed.
What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts.
Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media.
Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason.
If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: ""Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.""
There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.
In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.
That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.
Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.
So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.
This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.
The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.
Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.
And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.
But the scandal is far from over.
Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.
And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.
""For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,"" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.
""I could never have imagined that.""
The treason investigation has now been suspended.
But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.
It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians ""to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient"".
Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.
What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?
The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.

The latest protests are a reaction to him sacking two finance ministers last week, further damaging confidence in the economy.
This comes on top of claims of widespread corruption, recent student protests and a succession battle in the governing African National Congress.
The marchers are using the hasthag #ZumaMustFall on social media.
The #ZumaMustFall hashtag is a modification of #FeesMustFall which was used to organise protests against a rise in university fees.
Before that, #RhodesMustFall was used to demand a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town's campus.
""It feels like the start of something big,"" a woman in her 50s called Lianda told me.
It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising.
For her it was important to join the demonstrations with her teenage daughters ""for the sake of their future"". So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability.
But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC.
Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president.
Yet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC.
This may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder.
The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year.
However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption.
Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned.
The appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night.

The female dog was discovered ""dumped like rubbish"" in the Overton area of Lancaster.
Racing greyhounds are tattooed on their right ears, and it is believed the ear was cut off to destroy identification information.
Campaigners are offering a £2,000 reward for information.
Greyhound protection group Caged North West was first alerted after spotting a photograph of the dog's body that was shared on the internet.
It then discovered the animal behind a water tank a few yards from Main Street.
The group later placed CCTV in the area, which recorded footage of a person with a dog searching the small area of ground behind the water tank.
Trudy Baker, of the Greytexploitations group, which has joined Caged North West to offer the reward, said it believed whoever dumped the dog had returned to the scene to remove the ear.
""It's incredibly sad but greyhounds are over-bred for the gambling industry, and the ones that no longer make the grade become disposable commodities,"" she said.
""We are hoping that this case ends in a prosecution.""
The campaigners said they would hand the CCTV footage to Lancashire Police.
A post-mortem examination of the animal was due to take place.

The veteran broadcaster died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 77.
The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of ""a true son of Limerick"", the city's mayor Liam Galvin said.
Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: ""He was the absolute governor.""
A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London.
In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners.
At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: ""He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years.
""All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident.
""And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.
""Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.""
Evans described Sir Terry as his ""radio dad"" and said that Radio 2 was ""in disbelief and shock"".
""He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,"" added Evans. ""He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.""
BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry ""one of the greatest broadcasters of our age"".
""Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,"" he said.
""You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.
""But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.""
Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a ""wonderful human being"".
""I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,"" he said.
Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was ""stunned"" at the news and that his condolences were ""very much with Helen and the family"".
Sir Terry died surrounded by his family ""after a short but brave battle with cancer"", a statement released by his family said.
He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.
An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.
The city's mayor said: ""Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.
""The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.""
President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was ""always proud of his origins in Limerick"", and returned frequently to his native country.
Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was ""shocked"" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had ""put it out that he had a bad back"".
The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.
""I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money.
""For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,"" he added.
Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon.
Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.
He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.
From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.
The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or ""Terry's Old Geezers and Gals"".
Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.
BBC director general Lord Hall said: ""He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.""
Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was ""one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard"".
Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.
Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a ""radio genius"", saying: ""The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.""
Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.
The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: ""Such a special and funny man.
""A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.""
Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity.
Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: ""He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster.
""He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.""
Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later.
When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: ""The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you.
""When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine.""
Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015.
The One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.

""And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.
""Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.""
Evans described Sir Terry as his ""radio dad"" and said that Radio 2 was ""in disbelief and shock"".
""He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,"" added Evans. ""He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.""
BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry ""one of the greatest broadcasters of our age"".
""Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,"" he said.
""You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.
""But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.""
Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a ""wonderful human being"".
""I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,"" he said.
Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was ""stunned"" at the news and that his condolences were ""very much with Helen and the family"".
Sir Terry died surrounded by his family ""after a short but brave battle with cancer"", a statement released by his family said.
He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.
An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.
The city's mayor said: ""Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.
""The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.""
President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was ""always proud of his origins in Limerick"", and returned frequently to his native country.
Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was ""shocked"" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had ""put it out that he had a bad back"".
The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.
""I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money.
""For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,"" he added.
Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon.
Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.
He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.
From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.
The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or ""Terry's Old Geezers and Gals"".
Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.
BBC director general Lord Hall said: ""He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.""
Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was ""one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard"".
Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.
Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a ""radio genius"", saying: ""The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.""
Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.
The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: ""Such a special and funny man.
""A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.""
Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity.
Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: ""He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster.
""He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.""
Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later.
When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: ""The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you.
""When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine.""
Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015.

But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed.
What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts.
Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media.
Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason.
If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: ""Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.""
There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.
In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.
That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.
Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.
So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.
This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.
The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.
Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.
And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.
But the scandal is far from over.
Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.
And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.
""For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,"" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.
""I could never have imagined that.""
The treason investigation has now been suspended.
But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.
It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians ""to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient"".
Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.
What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?
The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.

But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed.
What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts.
Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media.
Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason.
If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: ""Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.""
There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.
In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.
That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.
Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.
So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.
This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.
The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.
Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.
And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.
But the scandal is far from over.
Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.
And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.
""For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,"" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.
""I could never have imagined that.""
The treason investigation has now been suspended.
But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.
It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians ""to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient"".
Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.
What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?
The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.

The latest protests are a reaction to him sacking two finance ministers last week, further damaging confidence in the economy.
This comes on top of claims of widespread corruption, recent student protests and a succession battle in the governing African National Congress.
The marchers are using the hasthag #ZumaMustFall on social media.
The #ZumaMustFall hashtag is a modification of #FeesMustFall which was used to organise protests against a rise in university fees.
Before that, #RhodesMustFall was used to demand a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town's campus.
""It feels like the start of something big,"" a woman in her 50s called Lianda told me.
It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising.
For her it was important to join the demonstrations with her teenage daughters ""for the sake of their future"". So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability.
But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC.
Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president.
Yet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC.
This may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder.
The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year.
However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption.
Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned.
The appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night.

But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC.
Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president.
Yet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC.
This may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder.
The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year.
However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption.
Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned.
The appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night.

""The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.""

Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.

But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed.
What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts.
Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media.
Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason.
If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: ""Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.""
There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.
In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.
That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.
Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.
So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.
This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.
The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.
Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.
And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.
But the scandal is far from over.
Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.
And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.
""For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,"" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.
""I could never have imagined that.""
The treason investigation has now been suspended.
But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.
It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians ""to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient"".
Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.
What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?
The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.

Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.
And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.
But the scandal is far from over.
Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.
And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.
""For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,"" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.
""I could never have imagined that.""
The treason investigation has now been suspended.
But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.
It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians ""to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient"".
Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.
What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?
The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.

Article:
The latest protests are a reaction to him sacking two finance ministers last week, further damaging confidence in the economy.
This comes on top of claims of widespread corruption, recent student protests and a succession battle in the governing African National Congress.
The marchers are using the hasthag #ZumaMustFall on social media.
The #ZumaMustFall hashtag is a modification of #FeesMustFall which was used to organise protests against a rise in university fees.
Before that, #RhodesMustFall was used to demand a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town's campus.
""It feels like the start of something big,"" a woman in her 50s called Lianda told me.
It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising.
For her it was important to join the demonstrations with her teenage daughters ""for the sake of their future"". So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability.
But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC.
Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president.
Yet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC.
This may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder.
The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year.
However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption.
Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned.
The appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night.

The female dog was discovered ""dumped like rubbish"" in the Overton area of Lancaster.
Racing greyhounds are tattooed on their right ears, and it is believed the ear was cut off to destroy identification information.
Campaigners are offering a £2,000 reward for information.
Greyhound protection group Caged North West was first alerted after spotting a photograph of the dog's body that was shared on the internet.
It then discovered the animal behind a water tank a few yards from Main Street.
The group later placed CCTV in the area, which recorded footage of a person with a dog searching the small area of ground behind the water tank.
Trudy Baker, of the Greytexploitations group, which has joined Caged North West to offer the reward, said it believed whoever dumped the dog had returned to the scene to remove the ear.
""It's incredibly sad but greyhounds are over-bred for the gambling industry, and the ones that no longer make the grade become disposable commodities,"" she said.
""We are hoping that this case ends in a prosecution.""
The campaigners said they would hand the CCTV footage to Lancashire Police.
A post-mortem examination of the animal was due to take place.

Article:
The veteran broadcaster died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 77.
The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of ""a true son of Limerick"", the city's mayor Liam Galvin said.
Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: ""He was the absolute governor.""
A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London.
In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners.
At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: ""He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years.
""All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident.
""And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.
""Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.""
Evans described Sir Terry as his ""radio dad"" and said that Radio 2 was ""in disbelief and shock"".
""He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,"" added Evans. ""He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.""
BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry ""one of the greatest broadcasters of our age"".
""Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,"" he said.
""You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.
""But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.""
Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a ""wonderful human being"".
""I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,"" he said.
Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was ""stunned"" at the news and that his condolences were ""very much with Helen and the family"".
Sir Terry died surrounded by his family ""after a short but brave battle with cancer"", a statement released by his family said.
He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.
An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.
The city's mayor said: ""Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.
""The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.""
President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was ""always proud of his origins in Limerick"", and returned frequently to his native country.
Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was ""shocked"" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had ""put it out that he had a bad back"".
The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.
""I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money.
""For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,"" he added.
Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon.
Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.
He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.
From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.
The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or ""Terry's Old Geezers and Gals"".
Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.
BBC director general Lord Hall said: ""He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.""
Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was ""one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard"".
Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.
Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a ""radio genius"", saying: ""The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.""
Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.
The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: ""Such a special and funny man.
""A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.""
Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity.
Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: ""He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster.
""He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.""
Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later.
When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: ""The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you.
""When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine.""
Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015.
The One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.

Article:
But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed.
What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts.
Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media.
Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason.
If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: ""Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.""
There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.
In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.
That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.
Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.
So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.
This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.
The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.
Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.
And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.
But the scandal is far from over.
Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.
And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.
""For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,"" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.
""I could never have imagined that.""
The treason investigation has now been suspended.
But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.
It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians ""to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient"".
Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.
What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?

Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media.

Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press. So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful. This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar.

The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.

The latest protests are a reaction to him sacking two finance ministers last week, further damaging confidence in the economy.
This comes on top of claims of widespread corruption, recent student protests and a succession battle in the governing African National Congress.
The marchers are using the hasthag #ZumaMustFall on social media.
The #ZumaMustFall hashtag is a modification of #FeesMustFall which was used to organise protests against a rise in university fees.
Before that, #RhodesMustFall was used to demand a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town's campus.
""It feels like the start of something big,"" a woman in her 50s called Lianda told me.
It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising.
For her it was important to join the demonstrations with her teenage daughters ""for the sake of their future"". So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability.
But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC.
Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president.
Yet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC.
This may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder.
The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year.
However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption.
Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned.
The appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night.

The veteran broadcaster died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 77.
The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of ""a true son of Limerick"", the city's mayor Liam Galvin said.
Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: ""He was the absolute governor.""
A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London.
In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners.
At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: ""He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years.
""All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident.
""And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.
""Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.""
Evans described Sir Terry as his ""radio dad"" and said that Radio 2 was ""in disbelief and shock"".
""He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,"" added Evans. ""He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.""
BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry ""one of the greatest broadcasters of our age"".
""Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,"" he said.
""You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.
""But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.""
Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a ""wonderful human being"".
""I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,"" he said.
Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was ""stunned"" at the news and that his condolences were ""very much with Helen and the family"".
Sir Terry died surrounded by his family ""after a short but brave battle with cancer"", a statement released by his family said.
He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.
An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.
The city's mayor said: ""Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.
""The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.""
President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was ""always proud of his origins in Limerick"", and returned frequently to his native country.
Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was ""shocked"" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had ""put it out that he had a bad back"".
The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.
""I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money.
""For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,"" he added.
Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon.
Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.
He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.
From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.
The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or ""Terry's Old Geezers and Gals"".
Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.
BBC director general Lord Hall said: ""He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.""
Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was ""one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard"".
Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.
Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a ""radio genius"", saying: ""The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.""
Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.
The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: ""Such a special and funny man.
""A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.""
Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity.
Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: ""He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster.
""He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.""
Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later.
When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: ""The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you.
""When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine.""
Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015.
The One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.

Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media.

The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: ""Such a special and funny man.
""A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.""
Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity.
Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: ""He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster.
""He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.""
Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later.
When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: ""The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you.
""When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine.""
Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015.
The One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.

Article:
But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed.
What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts.
Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media.
Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason.
If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: ""Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.""
There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.
In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.
That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.
Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.
So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.
This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.
The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.
Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.
And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.
But the scandal is far from over.
Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.
And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.
""For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,"" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.
""I could never have imagined that.""
The treason investigation has now been suspended.
But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.
It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians ""to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient"".
Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.
What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?
The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.

The latest protests are a reaction to him sacking two finance ministers last week, further damaging confidence in the economy.
This comes on top of claims of widespread corruption, recent student protests and a succession battle in the governing African National Congress.
The marchers are using the hasthag #ZumaMustFall on social media.
The #ZumaMustFall hashtag is a modification of #FeesMustFall which was used to organise protests against a rise in university fees.
Before that, #RhodesMustFall was used to demand a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town's campus.
""It feels like the start of something big,"" a woman in her 50s called Lianda told me.
It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising.
For her it was important to join the demonstrations with her teenage daughters ""for the sake of their future"". So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability.
But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC.
Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president.
Yet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC.
This may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder.
The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year.
However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption.
Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned.
The appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night.

The female dog was discovered ""dumped like rubbish"" in the Overton area of Lancaster.

Greyhound protection group Caged North West was first alerted after spotting a photograph of the dog's body that was shared on the internet.

The veteran broadcaster died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 77.
The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of ""a true son of Limerick"", the city's mayor Liam Galvin said.
Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: ""He was the absolute governor.""
A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London.
In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners.
At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: ""He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years.
""All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident.
""And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.
""Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.""
Evans described Sir Terry as his ""radio dad"" and said that Radio 2 was ""in disbelief and shock"".
""He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,"" added Evans. ""He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.""
BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry ""one of the greatest broadcasters of our age"".
""Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,"" he said.
""You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.
""But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.""
Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a ""wonderful human being"".
""I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,"" he said.
Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was ""stunned"" at the news and that his condolences were ""very much with Helen and the family"".
Sir Terry died surrounded by his family ""after a short but brave battle with cancer"", a statement released by his family said.
He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.
An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.
The city's mayor said: ""Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.
""The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.""
President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was ""always proud of his origins in Limerick"", and returned frequently to his native country.
Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was ""shocked"" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had ""put it out that he had a bad back"".
The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.
""I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money.
""For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,"" he added.
Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon.
Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.
He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.
From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.
The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or ""Terry's Old Geezers and Gals"".
Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.
BBC director general Lord Hall said: ""He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.""
Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was ""one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard"".
Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.
Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a ""radio genius"", saying: ""The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.""
Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.
The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: ""Such a special and funny man.
""A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.""
Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity.
Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: ""He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster.
""He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.""
Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later.

Sir Terry died surrounded by his family ""after a short but brave battle with cancer"", a statement released by his family said.
He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.
An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.
The city's mayor said: ""Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.
""The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.""
President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was ""always proud of his origins in Limerick"", and returned frequently to his native country.
Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was ""shocked"" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had ""put it out that he had a bad back"".
The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.
""I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money.
""For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,"" he added.
Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon.
Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.
He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.
From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.
The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or ""Terry's Old Geezers and Gals"".
Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.
BBC director general Lord Hall said: ""He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.""
Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was ""one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard"".
Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.
Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a ""radio genius"", saying: ""The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.""
Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.
The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: ""Such a special and funny man.
""A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.""
Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity.
Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: ""He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster.
""He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.""
Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later.
When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: ""The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you.
""When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine.""
Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015.
The One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.

Article:
But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed.
What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts.
Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media.
Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason.
If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: ""Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.""
There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.
In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.
That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.
Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.
So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.
This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.
The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.
Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.
And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.
But the scandal is far from over.
Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.
And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.
""For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,"" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.
""I could never have imagined that.""
The treason investigation has now been suspended.
But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.
It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians ""to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient"".
Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.
What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?
The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.

The latest protests are a reaction to him sacking two finance ministers last week, further damaging confidence in the economy.
This comes on top of claims of widespread corruption, recent student protests and a succession battle in the governing African National Congress.
The marchers are using the hasthag #ZumaMustFall on social media.
The #ZumaMustFall hashtag is a modification of #FeesMustFall which was used to organise protests against a rise in university fees.
Before that, #RhodesMustFall was used to demand a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town's campus.
""It feels like the start of something big,"" a woman in her 50s called Lianda told me.
It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising.
For her it was important to join the demonstrations with her teenage daughters ""for the sake of their future"". So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability.
But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC.
Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president.
Yet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC.
This may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder.
The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year.
However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption.
Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned.
The appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night.

Racing greyhounds are tattooed on their right ears, and it is believed the ear was cut off to destroy identification information.
Campaigners are offering a £2,000 reward for information.
Greyhound protection group Caged North West was first alerted after spotting a photograph of the dog's body that was shared on the internet.
It then discovered the animal behind a water tank a few yards from Main Street.
The group later placed CCTV in the area, which recorded footage of a person with a dog searching the small area of ground behind the water tank.
Trudy Baker, of the Greytexploitations group, which has joined Caged North West to offer the reward, said it believed whoever dumped the dog had returned to the scene to remove the ear.
""It's incredibly sad but greyhounds are over-bred for the gambling industry, and the ones that no longer make the grade become disposable commodities,"" she said.
""We are hoping that this case ends in a prosecution.""
The campaigners said they would hand the CCTV footage to Lancashire Police.

The veteran broadcaster died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 77.
The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of ""a true son of Limerick"", the city's mayor Liam Galvin said.
Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: ""He was the absolute governor.""
A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London.
In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners.
At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: ""He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years.
""All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident.
""And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.
""Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.""
Evans described Sir Terry as his ""radio dad"" and said that Radio 2 was ""in disbelief and shock"".
""He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,"" added Evans. ""He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.""
BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry ""one of the greatest broadcasters of our age"".
""Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,"" he said.
""You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.
""But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.""
Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a ""wonderful human being"".
""I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,"" he said.

The latest protests are a reaction to him sacking two finance ministers last week, further damaging confidence in the economy.
This comes on top of claims of widespread corruption, recent student protests and a succession battle in the governing African National Congress.
The marchers are using the hasthag #ZumaMustFall on social media.
The #ZumaMustFall hashtag is a modification of #FeesMustFall which was used to organise protests against a rise in university fees.
Before that, #RhodesMustFall was used to demand a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town's campus.
""It feels like the start of something big,"" a woman in her 50s called Lianda told me.
It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising.
For her it was important to join the demonstrations with her teenage daughters ""for the sake of their future"". So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability.
But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC.
Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president.
Yet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC.
This may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder.
The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year.
However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption.
Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned.
The appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night.

Racing greyhounds are tattooed on their right ears, and it is believed the ear was cut off to destroy identification information.
Campaigners are offering a £2,000 reward for information.
Greyhound protection group Caged North West was first alerted after spotting a photograph of the dog's body that was shared on the internet.
It then discovered the animal behind a water tank a few yards from Main Street.
The group later placed CCTV in the area, which recorded footage of a person with a dog searching the small area of ground behind the water tank.
Trudy Baker, of the Greytexploitations group, which has joined Caged North West to offer the reward, said it believed whoever dumped the dog had returned to the scene to remove the ear.
""It's incredibly sad but greyhounds are over-bred for the gambling industry, and the ones that no longer make the grade become disposable commodities,"" she said.
""We are hoping that this case ends in a prosecution.""
The campaigners said they would hand the CCTV footage to Lancashire Police.
A post-mortem examination of the animal was due to take place.

The female dog was discovered ""dumped like rubbish"" in the Overton area of Lancaster.
Racing greyhounds are tattooed on their right ears, and it is believed the ear was cut off to destroy identification information.
Campaigners are offering a £2,000 reward for information.
Greyhound protection group Caged North West was first alerted after spotting a photograph of the dog's body that was shared on the internet.
It then discovered the animal behind a water tank a few yards from Main Street.
The group later placed CCTV in the area, which recorded footage of a person with a dog searching the small area of ground behind the water tank.
Trudy Baker, of the Greytexploitations group, which has joined Caged North West to offer the reward, said it believed whoever dumped the dog had returned to the scene to remove the ear.
""It's incredibly sad but greyhounds are over-bred for the gambling industry, and the ones that no longer make the grade become disposable commodities,"" she said.
""We are hoping that this case ends in a prosecution.""
The campaigners said they would hand the CCTV footage to Lancashire Police.
A post-mortem examination of the animal was due to take place.

The veteran broadcaster died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 77.
The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of ""a true son of Limerick"", the city's mayor Liam Galvin said.
Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: ""He was the absolute governor.""
A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London.
In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners.
At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: ""He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years.
""All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident.
""And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.
""Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.""
Evans described Sir Terry as his ""radio dad"" and said that Radio 2 was ""in disbelief and shock"".
""He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,"" added Evans. ""He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.""
BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry ""one of the greatest broadcasters of our age"".
""Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,"" he said.
""You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.
""But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.""
Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a ""wonderful human being"".
""I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,"" he said.
Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was ""stunned"" at the news and that his condolences were ""very much with Helen and the family"".
Sir Terry died surrounded by his family ""after a short but brave battle with cancer"", a statement released by his family said.
He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.
An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.
The city's mayor said: ""Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.
""The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.""
President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was ""always proud of his origins in Limerick"", and returned frequently to his native country.
Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was ""shocked"" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had ""put it out that he had a bad back"".
The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.
""I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money.
""For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,"" he added.
Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon.
Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.
He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.
From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.
The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or ""Terry's Old Geezers and Gals"".
Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.
BBC director general Lord Hall said: ""He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.""
Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was ""one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard"".
Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.
Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a ""radio genius"", saying: ""The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.""
Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.
The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: ""Such a special and funny man.
""A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.""
Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity.
Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: ""He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster.
""He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.""
Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later.
When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: ""The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you.
""When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine.""
Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015.

But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed.
What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts.
Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media.
Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason.
If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: ""Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.""
There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.
In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.
That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.
Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.
So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.
This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.
The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.
Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.
And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.
But the scandal is far from over.
Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.
And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.
""For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,"" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.
""I could never have imagined that.""
The treason investigation has now been suspended.
But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.
It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians ""to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient"".
Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.
What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?
The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.

The latest protests are a reaction to him sacking two finance ministers last week, further damaging confidence in the economy.
This comes on top of claims of widespread corruption, recent student protests and a succession battle in the governing African National Congress.
The marchers are using the hasthag #ZumaMustFall on social media.
The #ZumaMustFall hashtag is a modification of #FeesMustFall which was used to organise protests against a rise in university fees.
Before that, #RhodesMustFall was used to demand a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town's campus.
""It feels like the start of something big,"" a woman in her 50s called Lianda told me.
It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising.
For her it was important to join the demonstrations with her teenage daughters ""for the sake of their future"". So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability.
But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC.
Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president.
Yet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC.
This may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder.
The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year.
However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption.
Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned.
The appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night.

The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.

The latest protests are a reaction to him sacking two finance ministers last week, further damaging confidence in the economy.
This comes on top of claims of widespread corruption, recent student protests and a succession battle in the governing African National Congress.
The marchers are using the hasthag #ZumaMustFall on social media.
The #ZumaMustFall hashtag is a modification of #FeesMustFall which was used to organise protests against a rise in university fees.
Before that, #RhodesMustFall was used to demand a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town's campus.
""It feels like the start of something big,"" a woman in her 50s called Lianda told me.
It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising.
For her it was important to join the demonstrations with her teenage daughters ""for the sake of their future"". So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability.
But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC.
Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president.
Yet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC.
This may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder.
The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year.
However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption.
Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned.
The appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night.

The female dog was discovered ""dumped like rubbish"" in the Overton area of Lancaster.
Racing greyhounds are tattooed on their right ears, and it is believed the ear was cut off to destroy identification information.
Campaigners are offering a £2,000 reward for information.
Greyhound protection group Caged North West was first alerted after spotting a photograph of the dog's body that was shared on the internet.
It then discovered the animal behind a water tank a few yards from Main Street.
The group later placed CCTV in the area, which recorded footage of a person with a dog searching the small area of ground behind the water tank.
Trudy Baker, of the Greytexploitations group, which has joined Caged North West to offer the reward, said it believed whoever dumped the dog had returned to the scene to remove the ear.
""It's incredibly sad but greyhounds are over-bred for the gambling industry, and the ones that no longer make the grade become disposable commodities,"" she said.
""We are hoping that this case ends in a prosecution.""
The campaigners said they would hand the CCTV footage to Lancashire Police.
A post-mortem examination of the animal was due to take place.

The veteran broadcaster died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 77.
The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of ""a true son of Limerick"", the city's mayor Liam Galvin said.
Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: ""He was the absolute governor.""
A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London.
In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners.
At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: ""He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years.
""All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident.
""And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.
""Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.""
Evans described Sir Terry as his ""radio dad"" and said that Radio 2 was ""in disbelief and shock"".
""He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,"" added Evans. ""He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.""
BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry ""one of the greatest broadcasters of our age"".
""Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,"" he said.
""You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.
""But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.""
Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a ""wonderful human being"".
""I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,"" he said.
Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was ""stunned"" at the news and that his condolences were ""very much with Helen and the family"".
Sir Terry died surrounded by his family ""after a short but brave battle with cancer"", a statement released by his family said.
He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.
An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.
The city's mayor said: ""Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.
""The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.""
President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was ""always proud of his origins in Limerick"", and returned frequently to his native country.
Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was ""shocked"" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had ""put it out that he had a bad back"".
The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.
""I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money.
""For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,"" he added.
Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon.
Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.
He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.
From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.
The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or ""Terry's Old Geezers and Gals"".
Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.
BBC director general Lord Hall said: ""He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.""
Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was ""one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard"".
Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.
Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a ""radio genius"", saying: ""The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.""
Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.
The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: ""Such a special and funny man.
""A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.""
Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity.
Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: ""He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster.
""He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.""
Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later.
When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: ""The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you.
""When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine.""
Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015.
The One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.

But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed.
What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts.
Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media.
Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason.
If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: ""Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.""
There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.
In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.
That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.
Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.
So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.
This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.
The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.
Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.
And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.
But the scandal is far from over.
Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.
And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.
""For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,"" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.
""I could never have imagined that.""
The treason investigation has now been suspended.
But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.
It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians ""to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient"".
Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.
What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?
The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.
