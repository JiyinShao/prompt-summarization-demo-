But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \"likely a separate\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \"providing aid and comfort\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists.\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\" he said. \"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.\n",

Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.'

Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.'

    "prompt": "The following should be summarized article:\n\n(CNN)He was known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that's devoted blood and resources to attacking it. But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \"likely a separate\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \"providing aid and comfort\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists.\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\" he said. \"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.",

But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \"likely a separate\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \"providing aid and comfort\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists.\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\" he said. \"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child.

Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records.

The president opened his speech on the South Lawn by remarking 'that whole (deflategate) story got blown out of proportion,' referring to an investigation that 11 out of 12 footballs used in the AFC Championship game were under-inflated. But then came the zinger:\u00a0'I usually tell a bunch of jokes at these events, but with the Patriots in town I was worried that 11 out of 12 of them would fall flat.' Scroll down for video . Boo!

Obama also quipped that he wished Chicago could learn something from Boston's championship-winning ways . Disapproval rating: Head coach Bill Belichick gives the thumbs down after Obama cracked a de-flate gate joke that left the whole team groaning . Obama received a custom jersey and a custom football from the team at the White House on Thursday . The Patriots assembled behind him groaned. Coach Bill Belichick, who is notoriously humorless, responded by giving the president a thumbs down. Obama was flanked by Belichick and billionaire Patriots owner Bob Kraft. Missing from the occasion, though was the Super Bowl MVP and the team's biggest star - Tom Brady. A spokesman for the team cited 'prior family commitments' as the reason Brady, 37, didn't attend the ceremony. Sports commentators, including retired football great Boomer Esiason, speculated that Brady snubbed Obama because he's from the 'wrong political party.' The superstar athlete has been to the White House before. He does have three other Super Bowl rings, afterall. But all the prior championships were under the Bush Administration. February's win was the first for the Patriots since Obama took office. Brady has also met Obama at least once before, as well. He was pictured with the then-US Senator  at the 2005 White House Correspondents dinner. Showoffs: The New England Patriots gathered the team's four Super Bowl trophies won under Coach Bill Belichick (right, next to President Barack Obama).

His supermodel wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen, usually active on social media, gives no hint where the family is today if not in Washington. Brady led the Patriots to his fourth Super Bowl victory in February after defeating the Seattle Seahawks 28-24. Despite his arm and movement being somewhat diminished by age, Brady's leadership and calm under pressure also won him Super Bowl MVP - his third. Whatever is taking up Brady's time this week, he made time next week to be ringside at the Floyd Mayweather Jr.-Manny Pacquiao fight in Las Vegas next weekend. According to Sport Illustrated, Brady appealed directly to CBS president Les Moonves for tickets to the much-touted matchup.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following article:\n\n(CNN)He was known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that's devoted blood and resources to attacking it. But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \"likely a separate\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \"providing aid and comfort\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists.\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\" he said. \"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child.

But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \"likely a separate\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \"providing aid and comfort\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists.\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\" he said. \"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.\n\nGenerate the Summary according to the examples:\n",

Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.'

Summary: Southern California hit by rare snowstorm, closing schools and delaying traffic. Now there is an document: President Barack Obama invited the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots to the White House on Thursday - but couldn't help but get one last deflategate joke in. The president opened his speech on the South Lawn by remarking 'that whole (deflategate) story got blown out of proportion,' referring to an investigation that 11 out of 12 footballs used in the AFC Championship game were under-inflated. But then came the zinger: 'I usually tell a bunch of jokes at these events, but with the Patriots in town I was worried that 11 out of 12 of them would fall flat.' Scroll down for video . Boo! Hiss! President Barack Obama elicited groans and a thumbs down from head coach Bill Belichick after cracking a deflategate joke while honoring the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots . Obama also quipped that he wished Chicago could learn something from Boston's championship-winning ways . Disapproval rating: Head coach Bill Belichick gives the thumbs down after Obama cracked a de-flate gate joke that left the whole team groaning . Obama received a custom jersey and a custom football from the team at the White House on Thursday . The Patriots assembled behind him groaned. Coach Bill Belichick, who is notoriously humorless, responded by giving the president a thumbs down. Obama was flanked by Belichick and billionaire Patriots owner Bob Kraft. Missing from the occasion, though was the Super Bowl MVP and the team's biggest star - Tom Brady. A spokesman for the team cited 'prior family commitments' as the reason Brady, 37, didn't attend the ceremony. Sports commentators, including retired football great Boomer Esiason, speculated that Brady snubbed Obama because he's from the 'wrong political party.' The superstar athlete has been to the White House before. He does have three other Super Bowl rings, afterall. But all the prior championships were under the Bush Administration. February's win was the first for the Patriots since Obama took office. Brady has also met Obama at least once before, as well. He was pictured with the then-US Senator at the 2005 White House Correspondents dinner. Showoffs: The New England Patriots gathered the team's four Super Bowl trophies won under Coach Bill Belichick (right, next to President Barack Obama). Brady won his fourth Super Bowl ring in February - and his first since President Obama took office . Tom Brady met President Barack Obama at least once. He is pictured here with the then-US Senator and rival quarterback Donovan McNabb in 2005 . It's not clear what Brady's prior commitment was. His supermodel wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen, usually active on social media, gives no hint where the family is today if not in Washington. Brady led the Patriots to his fourth Super Bowl victory in February after defeating the Seattle Seahawks 28-24. Despite his arm and movement being somewhat diminished by age, Brady's leadership and calm under pressure also won him Super Bowl MVP - his third. Whatever is taking up Brady's time this week, he made time next week to be ringside at the Floyd Mayweather Jr.-Manny Pacquiao fight in Las Vegas next weekend. According to Sport Illustrated, Brady appealed directly to CBS president Les Moonves for tickets to the much-touted matchup.

Rangers have promised to probe claims Mike Ashley has grabbed control of the club's badges . Reports emerged suggesting the Newcastle owner was now the official owner of the Light Blues trademarks . But now Dave King's new regime have promised a speedy investigation after documents appeared on the government-run Intellectual Property Office (IPO) website showing the club's trademarks were now controlled by SportsDirect.com Retail Ltd. In a statement a club spokesman said: 'The board is currently conducting a review of all contractual documentation but this particular issue has become a matter of urgency.'

The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.'

Weather officials say it's the heaviest snowfall in the region in over 20 years.\n\nSummary:\nSouthern California hit by rare snowstorm, closing schools and delaying traffic.\n\nNow there is an article:\n\n(CNN)He was known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that's devoted blood and resources to attacking it. But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \"likely a separate\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \"providing aid and comfort\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists.\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\" he said. \"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child.

But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \"likely a separate\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \"providing aid and comfort\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists.\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\" he said. \"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child.

Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.'

The president opened his speech on the South Lawn by remarking 'that whole (deflategate) story got blown out of proportion,' referring to an investigation that 11 out of 12 footballs used in the AFC Championship game were under-inflated. But then came the zinger:\u00a0'I usually tell a bunch of jokes at these events, but with the Patriots in town I was worried that 11 out of 12 of them would fall flat.' Scroll down for video . Boo! Hiss! President Barack Obama elicited groans and a thumbs down from head coach Bill Belichick after cracking a deflategate joke while honoring the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots . Obama also quipped that he wished Chicago could learn something from Boston's championship-winning ways . Disapproval rating: Head coach Bill Belichick gives the thumbs down after Obama cracked a de-flate gate joke that left the whole team groaning . Obama received a custom jersey and a custom football from the team at the White House on Thursday . The Patriots assembled behind him groaned. Coach Bill Belichick, who is notoriously humorless, responded by giving the president a thumbs down. Obama was flanked by Belichick and billionaire Patriots owner Bob Kraft. Missing from the occasion, though was the Super Bowl MVP and the team's biggest star - Tom Brady. A spokesman for the team cited 'prior family commitments' as the reason Brady, 37, didn't attend the ceremony. Sports commentators, including retired football great Boomer Esiason, speculated that Brady snubbed Obama because he's from the 'wrong political party.' The superstar athlete has been to the White House before. He does have three other Super Bowl rings, afterall. But all the prior championships were under the Bush Administration. February's win was the first for the Patriots since Obama took office. Brady has also met Obama at least once before, as well. He was pictured with the then-US Senator  at the 2005 White House Correspondents dinner. Showoffs: The New England Patriots gathered the team's four Super Bowl trophies won under Coach Bill Belichick (right, next to President Barack Obama). Brady won his fourth Super Bowl ring in February - and his first since President Obama took office . Tom Brady met President Barack Obama at least once. He is pictured here with the then-US Senator and rival quarterback Donovan McNabb in 2005 . It's not clear what Brady's prior commitment was. His supermodel wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen, usually active on social media, gives no hint where the family is today if not in Washington. Brady led the Patriots to his fourth Super Bowl victory in February after defeating the Seattle Seahawks 28-24. Despite his arm and movement being somewhat diminished by age, Brady's leadership and calm under pressure also won him Super Bowl MVP - his third. Whatever is taking up Brady's time this week, he made time next week to be ringside at the Floyd Mayweather Jr.-Manny Pacquiao fight in Las Vegas next weekend. According to Sport Illustrated, Brady appealed directly to CBS president Les Moonves for tickets to the much-touted matchup.

He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there.

Obama also quipped that he wished Chicago could learn something from Boston's championship-winning ways . Disapproval rating: Head coach Bill Belichick gives the thumbs down after Obama cracked a de-flate gate joke that left the whole team groaning . Obama received a custom jersey and a custom football from the team at the White House on Thursday . The Patriots assembled behind him groaned. Coach Bill Belichick, who is notoriously humorless, responded by giving the president a thumbs down. Obama was flanked by Belichick and billionaire Patriots owner Bob Kraft. Missing from the occasion, though was the Super Bowl MVP and the team's biggest star - Tom Brady. A spokesman for the team cited 'prior family commitments' as the reason Brady, 37, didn't attend the ceremony. Sports commentators, including retired football great Boomer Esiason, speculated that Brady snubbed Obama because he's from the 'wrong political party.' The superstar athlete has been to the White House before. He does have three other Super Bowl rings, afterall. But all the prior championships were under the Bush Administration. February's win was the first for the Patriots since Obama took office. Brady has also met Obama at least once before, as well. He was pictured with the then-US Senator  at the 2005 White House Correspondents dinner.

Brady won his fourth Super Bowl ring in February - and his first since President Obama took office . Tom Brady met President Barack Obama at least once. He is pictured here with the then-US Senator and rival quarterback Donovan McNabb in 2005 . It's not clear what Brady's prior commitment was. His supermodel wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen, usually active on social media, gives no hint where the family is today if not in Washington. Brady led the Patriots to his fourth Super Bowl victory in February after defeating the Seattle Seahawks 28-24. Despite his arm and movement being somewhat diminished by age, Brady's leadership and calm under pressure also won him Super Bowl MVP - his third. Whatever is taking up Brady's time this week, he made time next week to be ringside at the Floyd Mayweather Jr.-Manny Pacquiao fight in Las Vegas next weekend. According to Sport Illustrated, Brady appealed directly to CBS president Les Moonves for tickets to the much-touted matchup.

But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \"likely a separate\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \"providing aid and comfort\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists.\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\" he said. \"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child.

But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \"likely a separate\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \"providing aid and comfort\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists.\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\" he said. \"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.\n",

Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.'

Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.'

But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \"likely a separate\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \"providing aid and comfort\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists.\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\" he said. \"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.\n\nRewritten: Ensure key points are highlighted and clauses are ordered for clarity.",

But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \"likely a separate\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \"providing aid and comfort\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists.\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\" he said. \"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child.

He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy.

Obama received a custom jersey and a custom football from the team at the White House on Thursday . The Patriots assembled behind him groaned. Coach Bill Belichick, who is notoriously humorless, responded by giving the president a thumbs down. Obama was flanked by Belichick and billionaire Patriots owner Bob Kraft. Missing from the occasion, though was the Super Bowl MVP and the team's biggest star - Tom Brady. A spokesman for the team cited 'prior family commitments' as the reason Brady, 37, didn't attend the ceremony. Sports commentators, including retired football great Boomer Esiason, speculated that Brady snubbed Obama because he's from the 'wrong political party.'

Brady led the Patriots to his fourth Super Bowl victory in February after defeating the Seattle Seahawks 28-24. Despite his arm and movement being somewhat diminished by age, Brady's leadership and calm under pressure also won him Super Bowl MVP - his third.

But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \"likely a separate\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \"providing aid and comfort\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists.\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\" he said. \"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child.

Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \"providing aid and comfort\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists.\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\" he said. \"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.\n",

Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.'

Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \"likely a separate\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement.

White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish.

But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \"likely a separate\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \"providing aid and comfort\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists.\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\" he said. \"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child.

Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.'

But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \"likely a separate\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \"providing aid and comfort\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists.\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\" he said. \"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.\n\n\nAudience: Write for a 10-year-old reader with clear, accessible language.",

But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \"likely a separate\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \"providing aid and comfort\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists.\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\" he said. \"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child.

Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.'

The president opened his speech on the South Lawn by remarking 'that whole (deflategate) story got blown out of proportion,' referring to an investigation that 11 out of 12 footballs used in the AFC Championship game were under-inflated. But then came the zinger:\u00a0'I usually tell a bunch of jokes at these events, but with the Patriots in town I was worried that 11 out of 12 of them would fall flat.' Scroll down for video . Boo!

Obama also quipped that he wished Chicago could learn something from Boston's championship-winning ways . Disapproval rating: Head coach Bill Belichick gives the thumbs down after Obama cracked a de-flate gate joke that left the whole team groaning . Obama received a custom jersey and a custom football from the team at the White House on Thursday . The Patriots assembled behind him groaned. Coach Bill Belichick, who is notoriously humorless, responded by giving the president a thumbs down. Obama was flanked by Belichick and billionaire Patriots owner Bob Kraft. Missing from the occasion, though was the Super Bowl MVP and the team's biggest star - Tom Brady. A spokesman for the team cited 'prior family commitments' as the reason Brady, 37, didn't attend the ceremony. Sports commentators, including retired football great Boomer Esiason, speculated that Brady snubbed Obama because he's from the 'wrong political party.' The superstar athlete has been to the White House before. He does have three other Super Bowl rings, afterall. But all the prior championships were under the Bush Administration. February's win was the first for the Patriots since Obama took office. Brady has also met Obama at least once before, as well. He was pictured with the then-US Senator  at the 2005 White House Correspondents dinner. Showoffs: The New England Patriots gathered the team's four Super Bowl trophies won under Coach Bill Belichick (right, next to President Barack Obama). Brady won his fourth Super Bowl ring in February - and his first since President Obama took office . Tom Brady met President Barack Obama at least once. He is pictured here with the then-US Senator and rival quarterback Donovan McNabb in 2005 . It's not clear what Brady's prior commitment was. His supermodel wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen, usually active on social media, gives no hint where the family is today if not in Washington. Brady led the Patriots to his fourth Super Bowl victory in February after defeating the Seattle Seahawks 28-24. Despite his arm and movement being somewhat diminished by age, Brady's leadership and calm under pressure also won him Super Bowl MVP - his third. Whatever is taking up Brady's time this week, he made time next week to be ringside at the Floyd Mayweather Jr.-Manny Pacquiao fight in Las Vegas next weekend. According to Sport Illustrated, Brady appealed directly to CBS president Les Moonves for tickets to the much-touted matchup.

Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.'

But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \"likely a separate\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \"providing aid and comfort\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists.\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\" he said. \"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.",

He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \"providing aid and comfort\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists.\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\" he said. \"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child.

Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago.

John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost.

Obama received a custom jersey and a custom football from the team at the White House on Thursday . The Patriots assembled behind him groaned. Coach Bill Belichick, who is notoriously humorless, responded by giving the president a thumbs down. Obama was flanked by Belichick and billionaire Patriots owner Bob Kraft. Missing from the occasion, though was the Super Bowl MVP and the team's biggest star - Tom Brady. A spokesman for the team cited 'prior family commitments' as the reason Brady, 37, didn't attend the ceremony. Sports commentators, including retired football great Boomer Esiason, speculated that Brady snubbed Obama because he's from the 'wrong political party.'

But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \"likely a separate\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \"providing aid and comfort\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists.\" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. \"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. \"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\" he said. \"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, \"the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,\" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child.

Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.'

His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child.

Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.'
