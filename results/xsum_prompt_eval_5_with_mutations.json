    "prompt": "Summarize the following article:\n\nBut the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed.\nWhat started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts.\nEarlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media.\nLast week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason.\nIf the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: \"Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.\"\nThere was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.\nIn Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.\nThat seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.\nHitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.\nSo privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.\nThis historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.\nThe treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.\nWithin days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.\nAnd on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.\nBut the scandal is far from over.\nOpposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.\nAnd Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.\n\"For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,\" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.\n\"I could never have imagined that.\"\nThe treason investigation has now been suspended.\nBut chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.\nIt was not acceptable, he said, for politicians \"to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient\".\nInstead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.\nWhat is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?\nThe fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.\n",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following document: But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed. What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts. Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media. Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason. If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: \"Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.\" There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik. In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up. That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century. Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press. So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful. This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare. The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll. Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation. And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor. But the scandal is far from over. Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place. And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities. \"For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,\" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD. \"I could never have imagined that.\" The treason investigation has now been suspended. But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings. It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians \"to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient\". Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions. What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway? The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.",

Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.\n\"Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.\"\nEvans described Sir Terry as his \"radio dad\" and said that Radio 2 was \"in disbelief and shock\".\n\"He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,\" added Evans. \"He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.\"\nBBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry \"one of the greatest broadcasters of our age\".\n\"Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,\" he said.\n\"You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.\n\"But Terry had something else as well.

He had this fantastic sense of humour,\" he said.\nVeteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was \"stunned\" at the news and that his condolences were \"very much with Helen and the family\".\nSir Terry died surrounded by his family \"after a short but brave battle with cancer\", a statement released by his family said.\nHe leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.\nAn online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.\nThe city's mayor said: \"Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.\n\"The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.\"\nPresident of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was \"always proud of his origins in Limerick\", and returned frequently to his native country.\nFamily friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was \"shocked\" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had \"put it out that he had a bad back\".\nThe Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.\n\"I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money.\n\"For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,\" he added.\nSir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon.\nBlessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.\nHe also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.\nFrom 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.\nThe second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or \"Terry's Old Geezers and Gals\".\nTributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.\nBBC director general Lord Hall said: \"He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.\"\nRadio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was \"one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard\".\nSir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.\nRadio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a \"radio genius\", saying: \"The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.\"\nSir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.\nThe singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: \"Such a special and funny man.\n\"A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.\"\nMembers of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity.\nNorman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: \"He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster.\n\"He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.\"\nSir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later.\nWhen he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: \"The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you.\n\"When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine.\"\nSir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015.\nThe One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.",

His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.\nHe also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.\nFrom 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.\nThe second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or \"Terry's Old Geezers and Gals\".\nTributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.\nBBC director general Lord Hall said: \"He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.

Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.\nIn Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.\nThat seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.\nHitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.\nSo privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.\nThis historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.\nThe treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.\nWithin days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.\nAnd on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.\nBut the scandal is far from over.\nOpposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.\nAnd Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.\n\"For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,\" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.\n\"I could never have imagined that.\"\nThe treason investigation has now been suspended.\nBut chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.\nIt was not acceptable, he said, for politicians \"to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient\".\nInstead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.\nWhat is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?\nThe fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.\n\n\nStyle: Use simple English, concise sentences, and bullet points if appropriate.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following article:\n\nBut the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed.\nWhat started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts.\nEarlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media.\nLast week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason.\nIf the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: \"Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.\"\nThere was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.\nIn Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.\nThat seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.\nHitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.\nSo privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.\nThis historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.\nThe treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.\nWithin days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.\nAnd on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.\nBut the scandal is far from over.\nOpposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.\nAnd Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.\n\"For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,\" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.\n\"I could never have imagined that.\"\nThe treason investigation has now been suspended.\nBut chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.\nIt was not acceptable, he said, for politicians \"to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient\".\nInstead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.\nWhat is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?\nThe fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.\n\n\nProcess:\n1) Extract 3\u20135 key points from the text.\n2) Rephrase them in your own words.\n3) Compose a coherent final summary.\nOutput only the final summary.",

Brief: Southern California hit by rare snowstorm, closing schools and delaying traffic. Now there is an article: The latest protests are a reaction to him sacking two finance ministers last week, further damaging confidence in the economy. This comes on top of claims of widespread corruption, recent student protests and a succession battle in the governing African National Congress. The marchers are using the hasthag #ZumaMustFall on social media. The #ZumaMustFall hashtag is a modification of #FeesMustFall which was used to organise protests against a rise in university fees. Before that, #RhodesMustFall was used to demand a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town's campus. \"It feels like the start of something big,\" a woman in her 50s called Lianda told me. It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising. For her it was key to join the demonstrations with her teenage daughters \"for the sake of their future\". So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability. But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC. Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president. Yet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC. This may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder. The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year. However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption. Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned. The appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night. Generate the Summary according to the examples:",

Greyhound protection group Caged North West was first alerted after spotting a photograph of the dog's body that was shared on the internet. It then discovered the animal behind a water tank a few yards from Main Street. The group later placed CCTV in the area, which recorded footage of a person with a dog searching the small area of ground behind the water tank. Trudy Baker, of the Greytexploitations group, which has joined Caged North West to offer the reward, said it believed whoever dumped the dog had returned to the scene to remove the ear. \"It's incredibly sad but greyhounds are over-bred for the gambling industry, and the ones that no longer make the grade become disposable commodities,\" she said. \"We are hoping that this case ends in a prosecution.\" The campaigners said they would hand the CCTV footage to Lancashire Police.

Summary: Southern California hit by rare snowstorm, closing schools and delaying traffic. Now there is an passage: The veteran broadcaster died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 77. The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of \"a true son of Limerick\", the city's mayor Liam Galvin said. Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: \"He was the absolute governor.\" A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London. In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners. At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: \"He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years. \"All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident. \"And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes. \"Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.\" Evans described Sir Terry as his \"radio dad\" and said that Radio 2 was \"in disbelief and shock\". \"He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,\" added Evans. \"He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.\" BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry \"one of the greatest broadcasters of our age\". \"Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,\" he said. \"You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one. \"But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.\" Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a \"wonderful human being\". \"I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,\" he said. Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was \"stunned\" at the news and that his condolences were \"very much with Helen and the family\". Sir Terry died surrounded by his family \"after a short but brave battle with cancer\", a statement released by his family said. He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy. An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning. The city's mayor said: \"Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots. \"The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.\" President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was \"always proud of his origins in Limerick\", and returned frequently to his native country. Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was \"shocked\" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had \"put it out that he had a bad back\". The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin. \"I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money. \"For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,\" he added. Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon. Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance. He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event. From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan. The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or \"Terry's Old Geezers and Gals\". Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday. BBC director general Lord Hall said: \"He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family. For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.\" Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was \"one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard\". Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career. Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a \"radio genius\", saying: \"The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.\" Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account. The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: \"Such a special and funny man. \"A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.\" Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity. Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: \"He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster. \"He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.\" Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later. When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: \"The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you. \"When you tell me how essential I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine.\" Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015.

Article: A rare snowstorm hit southern California yesterday, causing major traffic delays and school closures. Weather officials say it's the heaviest snowfall in the region in over 20 years. Overview: Southern California hit by rare snowstorm, closing schools and delaying traffic. Now there is an passage: But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed. What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts. Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media. Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason. If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: \"Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.\" There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik. In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up. That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century. Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press. So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful. This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare. The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll. Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation. And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor. But the scandal is far from over. Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place. And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities. \"For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,\" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD. \"I could never have imagined that.\" The treason investigation has now been suspended. But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings. It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians \"to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient\". Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions. What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway? The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.

Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.\n\"Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.\"\nEvans described Sir Terry as his \"radio dad\" and said that Radio 2 was \"in disbelief and shock\".\n\"He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,\" added Evans. \"He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.\"\nBBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry \"one of the greatest broadcasters of our age\".\n\"Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be.

The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.\nAn online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.\nThe city's mayor said: \"Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.\n\"The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.\"\nPresident of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was \"always proud of his origins in Limerick\", and returned frequently to his native country.\nFamily friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was \"shocked\" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had \"put it out that he had a bad back\".\nThe Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.\n\"I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money.\n\"For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,\" he added.\nSir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon.\nBlessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.\nHe also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.\nFrom 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.\nThe second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or \"Terry's Old Geezers and Gals\".\nTributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.\nBBC director general Lord Hall said: \"He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.\"\nRadio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was \"one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard\".\nSir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.\nRadio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a \"radio genius\", saying: \"The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.\"\nSir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.\nThe singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: \"Such a special and funny man.\n\"A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.\"\nMembers of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity.\nNorman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: \"He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster.\n\"He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.\"\nSir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later.\nWhen he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: \"The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you.\n\"When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine.\"\nSir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015.\nThe One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.\n\nGenerate the Summary according to the examples:\n\nRewritten: Ensure key points are highlighted and clauses are ordered for clarity.",

Weather officials say it's the heaviest snowfall in the region in over 20 years.\n\nSummary:\nSouthern California hit by rare snowstorm, closing schools and delaying traffic.\n\nNow there is an article:\n\nBut the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed.\nWhat started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts.\nEarlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media.\nLast week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason.\nIf the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: \"Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.\"\nThere was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.\nIn Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.\nThat seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.\nHitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.\nSo privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.\nThis historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.\nThe treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.\nWithin days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.\nAnd on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.\nBut the scandal is far from over.\nOpposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.\nAnd Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.\n\"For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,\" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.\n\"I could never have imagined that.\"\nThe treason investigation has now been suspended.\nBut chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.\nIt was not acceptable, he said, for politicians \"to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient\".\nInstead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.\nWhat is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?\nThe fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.\n\nGenerate the Summary according to the examples:\n\nRewritten: Ensure key points are highlighted and clauses are ordered for clarity.",

I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money.\n\"For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,\" he added.\nSir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon.\nBlessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.\nHe also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.\nFrom 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.\nThe second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or \"Terry's Old Geezers and Gals\".\nTributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.\nBBC director general Lord Hall said: \"He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.\"\nRadio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was \"one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard\".\nSir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.\nRadio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a \"radio genius\", saying: \"The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.\"\nSir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.\nThe singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: \"Such a special and funny man.\n\"A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.\"\nMembers of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity.\nNorman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: \"He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster.\n\"He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.\"\nSir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later.\nWhen he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: \"The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege.

Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.\nIn Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.\nThat seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.\nHitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.\nSo privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.\nThis historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.\nThe treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.\nWithin days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.\nAnd on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.\nBut the scandal is far from over.\nOpposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.\nAnd Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.\n\"For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,\" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.\n\"I could never have imagined that.\"\nThe treason investigation has now been suspended.\nBut chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.\nIt was not acceptable, he said, for politicians \"to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient\".\nInstead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.\nWhat is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?\nThe fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.\n\nGenerate the Summary according to the examples:\n\n\nStyle: Use simple English, concise sentences, and bullet points if appropriate.",

So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability.\nBut unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC.\nEarlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president.\nYet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC.\nThis may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder.\nThe ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year.\nHowever, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption.\nMr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned.\nThe appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night.\n\nGenerate the Summary according to the examples:\n\n\nAudience: Write for a 10-year-old reader with clear, accessible language.",

Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.\n\"Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.\"\nEvans described Sir Terry as his \"radio dad\" and said that Radio 2 was \"in disbelief and shock\".\n\"He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,\" added Evans. \"He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.\"\nBBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry \"one of the greatest broadcasters of our age\".\n\"Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,\" he said.\n\"You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.\n\"But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.\"\nPrime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a \"wonderful human being\".\n\"I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh.

And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.\nThe treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.\nWithin days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.\nAnd on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.\nBut the scandal is far from over.\nOpposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.\nAnd Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.\n\"For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,\" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.\n\"I could never have imagined that.\"\nThe treason investigation has now been suspended.\nBut chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.\nIt was not acceptable, he said, for politicians \"to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient\".\nInstead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.\nWhat is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?\nThe fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.\n\nGenerate the Summary according to the examples:\n\n\nAudience: Write for a 10-year-old reader with clear, accessible language.",

Weather officials say it's the heaviest snowfall in the region in over 20 years.\n\nSummary:\nSouthern California hit by rare snowstorm, closing schools and delaying traffic.\n\nNow there is an article:\n\nThe veteran broadcaster died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 77.\nThe books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of \"a true son of Limerick\", the city's mayor Liam Galvin said.\nEvans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: \"He was the absolute governor.\"\nA condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London.\nIn a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners.\nAt the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: \"He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years.\n\"All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident.\n\"And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.\n\"Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.\"\nEvans described Sir Terry as his \"radio dad\" and said that Radio 2 was \"in disbelief and shock\".\n\"He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,\" added Evans. \"He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.\"\nBBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry \"one of the greatest broadcasters of our age\".\n\"Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,\" he said.\n\"You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.\n\"But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.\"\nPrime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a \"wonderful human being\".\n\"I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,\" he said.\nVeteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was \"stunned\" at the news and that his condolences were \"very much with Helen and the family\".\nSir Terry died surrounded by his family \"after a short but brave battle with cancer\", a statement released by his family said.\nHe leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.\nAn online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.\nThe city's mayor said: \"Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.\n\"The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.\"\nPresident of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was \"always proud of his origins in Limerick\", and returned frequently to his native country.\nFamily friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was \"shocked\" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had \"put it out that he had a bad back\".\nThe Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.\n\"I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money.\n\"For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,\" he added.\nSir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon.\nBlessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.\nHe also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.\nFrom 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.\nThe second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or \"Terry's Old Geezers and Gals\".\nTributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.\nBBC director general Lord Hall said: \"He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.\"\nRadio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was \"one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard\".\nSir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.\nRadio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a \"radio genius\", saying: \"The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.\"\nSir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.\nThe singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: \"Such a special and funny man.\n\"A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.\"\nMembers of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity.\nNorman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: \"He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster.\n\"He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.\"\nSir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later.\nWhen he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: \"The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you.\n\"When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine.\"\nSir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015.\nThe One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.\n\nGenerate the Summary according to the examples:\n\n\nProcess:\n1) Extract 3\u20135 key points from the text.\n2) Rephrase them in your own words.\n3) Compose a coherent final summary.\nOutput only the final summary.",

Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.\nIn Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes.

This comes on top of claims of widespread corruption, recent student protests and a succession battle in the governing African National Congress. The marchers are using the hasthag #ZumaMustFall on social media. The #ZumaMustFall hashtag is a modification of #FeesMustFall which was used to organise protests against a rise in university fees. Before that, #RhodesMustFall was used to demand a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town's campus. \"It feels like the start of something big,\" a woman in her 50s called Lianda told me. It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising. For her it was key to join the demonstrations with her teenage daughters \"for the sake of their future\". So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability. But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC. Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president. Yet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC. This may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder. The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year. However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption. Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned. The appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night.",

Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media. Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason.

Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place. And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities. \"For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,\" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD. \"I could never have imagined that.\" The treason investigation has now been suspended.

    "prompt": "Please summarize the following article in two sentences using clear academic English:\n\nBut the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed.\nWhat started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts.\nEarlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media.\nLast week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason.\nIf the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: \"Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.\"\nThere was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.\nIn Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.\nThat seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.\nHitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.\nSo privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.\nThis historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.\nThe treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.\nWithin days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.\nAnd on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.\nBut the scandal is far from over.\nOpposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.\nAnd Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.\n\"For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,\" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.\n\"I could never have imagined that.\"\nThe treason investigation has now been suspended.\nBut chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.\nIt was not acceptable, he said, for politicians \"to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient\".\nInstead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.\nWhat is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?\nThe fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.\n\nRewritten: Ensure key points are highlighted and clauses are ordered for clarity.",

Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.\nIn Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.\nThat seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.\nHitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.\nSo privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.\nThis historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.\nThe treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.\nWithin days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.\nAnd on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.\nBut the scandal is far from over.\nOpposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.\nAnd Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.\n\"For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,\" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.\n\"I could never have imagined that.\"\nThe treason investigation has now been suspended.\nBut chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.\nIt was not acceptable, he said, for politicians \"to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient\".\nInstead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.\nWhat is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?\nThe fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.\n\n\nStyle: Use simple English, concise sentences, and bullet points if appropriate.",

Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.\n\"Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.\"\nEvans described Sir Terry as his \"radio dad\" and said that Radio 2 was \"in disbelief and shock\".\n\"He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,\" added Evans. \"He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.\"\nBBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry \"one of the greatest broadcasters of our age\".\n\"Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,\" he said.\n\"You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.\n\"But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.\"\nPrime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a \"wonderful human being\".\n\"I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,\" he said.\nVeteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was \"stunned\" at the news and that his condolences were \"very much with Helen and the family\".\nSir Terry died surrounded by his family \"after a short but brave battle with cancer\", a statement released by his family said.\nHe leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.\nAn online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.\nThe city's mayor said: \"Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.\n\"The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.\"\nPresident of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was \"always proud of his origins in Limerick\", and returned frequently to his native country.\nFamily friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was \"shocked\" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had \"put it out that he had a bad back\".\nThe Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.\n\"I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money.\n\"For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,\" he added.\nSir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon.\nBlessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.\nHe also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.\nFrom 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.\nThe second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or \"Terry's Old Geezers and Gals\".\nTributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.\nBBC director general Lord Hall said: \"He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.\"\nRadio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was \"one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard\".\nSir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.\nRadio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a \"radio genius\", saying: \"The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.\"\nSir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.\nThe singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: \"Such a special and funny man.\n\"A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.\"\nMembers of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity.\nNorman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: \"He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster.\n\"He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.\"\nSir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later.\nWhen he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: \"The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege.

Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.\nIn Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.\nThat seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.\nHitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.\nSo privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.\nThis historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.\nThe treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.\nWithin days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.\nAnd on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.\nBut the scandal is far from over.\nOpposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.\nAnd Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.\n\"For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,\" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.\n\"I could never have imagined that.\"\nThe treason investigation has now been suspended.\nBut chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.\nIt was not acceptable, he said, for politicians \"to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient\".\nInstead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.\nWhat is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?\nThe fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.\n\n\nProcess:\n1) Extract 3\u20135 key points from the text.\n2) Rephrase them in your own words.\n3) Compose a coherent final summary.\nOutput only the final summary.",

So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability.\nBut unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC.\nEarlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president.\nYet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC.\nThis may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder.\nThe ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year.\nHowever, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption.\nMr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned.\nThe appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night.\n",

Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.\nIn Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.\nThat seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.\nHitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.\nSo privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.\nThis historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.\nThe treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.\nWithin days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.\nAnd on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.\nBut the scandal is far from over.\nOpposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.\nAnd Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.\n\"For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,\" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.\n\"I could never have imagined that.\"\nThe treason investigation has now been suspended.\nBut chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.\nIt was not acceptable, he said, for politicians \"to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient\".\nInstead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.\nWhat is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?\nThe fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.\n",

This comes on top of claims of widespread corruption, recent student protests and a succession battle in the governing African National Congress. The marchers are using the hasthag #ZumaMustFall on social media. The #ZumaMustFall hashtag is a modification of #FeesMustFall which was used to organise protests against a rise in university fees. Before that, #RhodesMustFall was used to demand a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town's campus. \"It feels like the start of something big,\" a woman in her 50s called Lianda told me. It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising. For her it was key to join the demonstrations with her teenage daughters \"for the sake of their future\". So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability. But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC. Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president. Yet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC. This may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder. The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year. However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption. Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned. The appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night.",

The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of \"a true son of Limerick\", the city's mayor Liam Galvin said. Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: \"He was the absolute governor.\" A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London. In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners. At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: \"He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years. \"All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident. \"And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes. \"Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.\" Evans described Sir Terry as his \"radio dad\" and said that Radio 2 was \"in disbelief and shock\". \"He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,\" added Evans. \"He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.\" BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry \"one of the greatest broadcasters of our age\". \"Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,\" he said. \"You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one. \"But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.\" Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a \"wonderful human being\". \"I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,\" he said. Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was \"stunned\" at the news and that his condolences were \"very much with Helen and the family\". Sir Terry died surrounded by his family \"after a short but brave battle with cancer\", a statement released by his family said. He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy. An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning. The city's mayor said: \"Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots. \"The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.\" President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was \"always proud of his origins in Limerick\", and returned frequently to his native country. Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was \"shocked\" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had \"put it out that he had a bad back\". The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin. \"I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money. \"For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,\" he added. Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon. Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance. He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event. From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan. The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or \"Terry's Old Geezers and Gals\". Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday. BBC director general Lord Hall said: \"He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family. For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.\" Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was \"one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard\". Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career. Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a \"radio genius\", saying: \"The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.\" Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account. The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: \"Such a special and funny man. \"A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.\" Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity. Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: \"He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster. \"He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.\" Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later. When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: \"The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you. \"When you tell me how key I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine.\" Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015. The One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.",

The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.\nAn online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.\nThe city's mayor said: \"Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.\n\"The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.\"\nPresident of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was \"always proud of his origins in Limerick\", and returned frequently to his native country.\nFamily friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was \"shocked\" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had \"put it out that he had a bad back\".\nThe Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.\n\"I didn't know he was that seriously ill.

His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.\nHe also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.\nFrom 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.\nThe second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or \"Terry's Old Geezers and Gals\".\nTributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.\nBBC director general Lord Hall said: \"He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.\"\nRadio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was \"one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard\".\nSir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.\nRadio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a \"radio genius\", saying: \"The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.\"\nSir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.\nThe singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: \"Such a special and funny man.\n\"A brilliant broadcaster and presenter.

Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.\nIn Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.\nThat seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.\nHitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.\nSo privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.\nThis historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.\nThe treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.\nWithin days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.\nAnd on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.\nBut the scandal is far from over.\nOpposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.\nAnd Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.\n\"For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,\" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.\n\"I could never have imagined that.\"\nThe treason investigation has now been suspended.\nBut chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.\nIt was not acceptable, he said, for politicians \"to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient\".\nInstead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.\nWhat is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?\nThe fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.\n\nRewritten: Ensure key points are highlighted and clauses are ordered for clarity.",

Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.\nIn Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.\nThat seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.\nHitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.\nSo privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.\nThis historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.\nThe treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.\nWithin days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.\nAnd on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.\nBut the scandal is far from over.\nOpposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.\nAnd Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.\n\"For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,\" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.\n\"I could never have imagined that.\"\nThe treason investigation has now been suspended.\nBut chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.\nIt was not acceptable, he said, for politicians \"to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient\".\nInstead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.\nWhat is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?\nThe fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.\n\n\nAudience: Write for a 10-year-old reader with clear, accessible language.",

Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.\n\"Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.\"\nEvans described Sir Terry as his \"radio dad\" and said that Radio 2 was \"in disbelief and shock\".\n\"He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,\" added Evans. \"He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.\"\nBBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry \"one of the greatest broadcasters of our age\".\n\"Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,\" he said.\n\"You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.\n\"But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.\"\nPrime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a \"wonderful human being\".\n\"I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,\" he said.\nVeteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was \"stunned\" at the news and that his condolences were \"very much with Helen and the family\".\nSir Terry died surrounded by his family \"after a short but brave battle with cancer\", a statement released by his family said.\nHe leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.\nAn online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.\nThe city's mayor said: \"Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.\n\"The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.\"\nPresident of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was \"always proud of his origins in Limerick\", and returned frequently to his native country.\nFamily friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was \"shocked\" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had \"put it out that he had a bad back\".\nThe Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.\n\"I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money.\n\"For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,\" he added.\nSir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon.\nBlessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.\nHe also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.\nFrom 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.\nThe second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or \"Terry's Old Geezers and Gals\".\nTributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.\nBBC director general Lord Hall said: \"He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.\"\nRadio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was \"one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard\".\nSir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.\nRadio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a \"radio genius\", saying: \"The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.\"\nSir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.\nThe singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: \"Such a special and funny man.\n\"A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.\"\nMembers of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity.\nNorman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: \"He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster.\n\"He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.\"\nSir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later.\nWhen he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: \"The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you.\n\"When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving.

The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of \"a true son of Limerick\", the city's mayor Liam Galvin said. Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: \"He was the absolute governor.\" A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London. In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners. At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said: \"He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years. \"All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident. \"And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes. \"Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.\" Evans described Sir Terry as his \"radio dad\" and said that Radio 2 was \"in disbelief and shock\". \"He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,\" added Evans. \"He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.\" BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry \"one of the greatest broadcasters of our age\". \"Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,\" he said. \"You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one. \"But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.\" Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a \"wonderful human being\". \"I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,\" he said. Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was \"stunned\" at the news and that his condolences were \"very much with Helen and the family\". Sir Terry died surrounded by his family \"after a short but brave battle with cancer\", a statement released by his family said. He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy. An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning. The city's mayor said: \"Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots. \"The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.\" President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was \"always proud of his origins in Limerick\", and returned frequently to his native country. Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was \"shocked\" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had \"put it out that he had a bad back\". The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin. \"I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money. \"For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,\" he added. Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon. Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance. He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event. From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan. The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or \"Terry's Old Geezers and Gals\". Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday. BBC director general Lord Hall said: \"He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family. For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.\" Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was \"one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard\". Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career. Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a \"radio genius\", saying: \"The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.\" Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account. The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: \"Such a special and funny man. \"A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.\" Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity. Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: \"He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster. \"He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.\" Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later. When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: \"The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you. \"When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as essential in mine.\" Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015. The One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.",

    "prompt": "Explain the following text in simple language that a 10-year-old can understand: But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed. What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts. Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media. Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason. If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: \"Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years.\" There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik. In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up. That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century. Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press. So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful. This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare. The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll. Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation. And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor. But the scandal is far from over. Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place. And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities. \"For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,\" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD. \"I could never have imagined that.\" The treason investigation has now been suspended. But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings. It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians \"to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient\". Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions. What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway? The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.",

And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.\nThe treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.\nWithin days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.\nAnd on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.\nBut the scandal is far from over.\nOpposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.\nAnd Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.\n\"For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,\" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.\n\"I could never have imagined that.\"\nThe treason investigation has now been suspended.\nBut chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.\nIt was not acceptable, he said, for politicians \"to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient\".\nInstead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.\nWhat is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?\nThe fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.\n\nRewritten: Ensure key points are highlighted and clauses are ordered for clarity.",

He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,\" he said.\n\"You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.\n\"But Terry had something else as well.

The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.\nAn online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.\nThe city's mayor said: \"Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.\n\"The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.\"\nPresident of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was \"always proud of his origins in Limerick\", and returned frequently to his native country.\nFamily friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was \"shocked\" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had \"put it out that he had a bad back\".\nThe Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.\n\"I didn't know he was that seriously ill.

His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.\nHe also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.\nFrom 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.\nThe second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or \"Terry's Old Geezers and Gals\".\nTributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.\nBBC director general Lord Hall said: \"He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.\"\nRadio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was \"one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard\".\nSir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.\nRadio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a \"radio genius\", saying: \"The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.\"\nSir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.\nThe singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: \"Such a special and funny man.\n\"A brilliant broadcaster and presenter.

His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.\nHe also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.\nFrom 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.\nThe second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or \"Terry's Old Geezers and Gals\".\nTributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.\nBBC director general Lord Hall said: \"He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.\"\nRadio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was \"one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard\".\nSir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.\nRadio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a \"radio genius\", saying: \"The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.\"\nSir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.\nThe singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: \"Such a special and funny man.\n\"A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter.\"\nMembers of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals (TOGs) have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity.\nNorman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast: \"He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster.\n\"He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it.\"\nSir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later.\nWhen he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners: \"The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you.\n\"When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine.\"\nSir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015.\nThe One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.\n\n\nAudience: Write for a 10-year-old reader with clear, accessible language.",

Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik.\nIn Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up.\nThat seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century.\nHitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press.\nSo privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful.\nThis historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare.\nThe treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll.\nWithin days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation.\nAnd on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor.\nBut the scandal is far from over.\nOpposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place.\nAnd Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities.\n\"For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists,\" Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD.\n\"I could never have imagined that.\"\nThe treason investigation has now been suspended.\nBut chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings.\nIt was not acceptable, he said, for politicians \"to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient\".\nInstead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions.\nWhat is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway?\nThe fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.\n\n\nAudience: Write for a 10-year-old reader with clear, accessible language.",

He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,\" he said.\n\"You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy.
